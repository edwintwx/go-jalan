When we opened in 2008, we only had 1 beginner class. Today we have a full range of static pole courses from Level 1 to 8, and spinning pole courses and aerial arts courses. Many of our students have been with us since 1st year, and some are now winners in pole competitions, certified instructors and avid pole-performers (pole-formers, in short). We hope to see you soon. Let the pole be your pillar of strength. Remember, your body is capable of doing anything. It is the mind that needs convincing.",
