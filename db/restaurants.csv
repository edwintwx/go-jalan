The modern restaurant showcases an interesting array of his favourite recipes in Asia, paying humble tribute to different cuisines through Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore.

From the menu, the Laksa (S$32) is a glorious bowl of well-loved lemak (creamy coconut milk) broth. Brimming with chargrilled prawns tempura, jasmine tea-smoked onsen quail eggs and housemade dried shrimp floss, this luxe dish offers savoury decadence. Its spools of thick bee hoon are snipped in the beloved Singaporean Katong-style Laksa tradition so that one can slurp this bowl up with a spoon.

Another standout is the Chargrilled ""Bak Kut Teh"" Pork Ribs (S$38) which is marinated with over eight herbal spices for 12 hours. The tender char-grilled pork chops are complemented with angelica syrup-infused watermelon alongside with Bak Kut Teh-infused Barbecue sauce to create a dish reminiscent of earthier Malaysian-styled Bak Kut Teh.

In the day, it is a breakfast and tea lounge, serving up eggs, Viennoiseries, coffee, and high-tea platters. At lunchtime, treat yourself to tapas with a French-Asian profile, think spicy Scallop Brochette, ikura-studded Salmon Crostini, and smoky Kurobuta Pork Yakitori served up with cold soba noodles. By the night-time, all the good vibes come together to turn the space into a sexy wine and cocktail bar, serving hotel guests alongside the city’s swanky barflies, turning out barrel-aged cocktails and premium wines faster than you can say “martini”. The signatures here include a regal Cognac Old Fashioned, the Martinez, a forgotten classic made with gin and cherry liqueur, and a cheeky Coconut Negroni that puts a Singapore spin on the international favourite.

Those craving for something familiar will find it hard to say no to the 63Chicken Rice as the the local favourite is given a classy twist, featuring a perfectly poached chicken thigh atop a glistening bed of aromatic long grain rice. Finally, leave some space for the 63Garoupa Sweet & Sour as this tangy dish garnished with longan and dragonfruit is a tropical treat for the senses.

Or a classic Steak Frites, made with quality Argentinian beef, served up with a pat of herb butter and plenty of crispy shoestring fries. The pasta here is artisanal and they’re especially famous for their Lobster Pasta, half a lobster gracing a plate laden with a tangle of spaghetti, fresh San Marzano tomatoes, and garlic. The Wagyu Bolognese is just as good, a rich and meaty ragu made with a hearty veal stock and premium tomatoes before a generous dusting of Gran Padano cheese. Pair all this with one of the wines in their comprehensive selection, then settle down to the only logical conclusion to the meal: a Chocolate Lava Tart, so blissfully self-explanatory. There’s some serious chow to be had here, so book ahead to avoid disappointment!

8 Korean BBQ (Shaw Centre),"Korean BBQ is all about the meat, but at some barbecue joints, you end up scarfing down generic slabs of meat with little to no character or flavour. Not at Eight Korean BBQ, a sleek, industrial-chic barbecue joint at swanky Shaw Centre that prides itself on its meat know-how. Here, the focus is on exquisite cuts from premium varieties of beef and pork. They’ve sourced super-rare Mangalitza pork that has a rich meatiness and beautiful, flavourful fat, as well as Toriyama Wagyu beef, the “rolls royce” of high-end Japanese beef known for its buttery texture and flavour.
In true Korean style, you can have your meats seared unadorned, coated in a punchy marinade, or served up in a nourishing stew. The restaurant’s name is drawn from its signature dish, the Eight Colours Set, which brings eight portions of pork belly, each a different colour, from pink and unseasoned to a spicy, fiery red that signals its heavy gochujang flavour. Premium choices abound, a kind of choose-your-own-adventure Korean BBQ experience. Stop by for funky Korean BBQ and experience some of the best meat the world has to offer!

8 Korean BBQ (The Central),"My oh my do we love some Korean grilled meats. Our latest craze? None other than E!GHT Korean BBQ, located at The Central at Clarke Quay. The exclamation mark in lieu for the letter ‘i’ is warranted at E!GHT Korean BBQ, as any food lover would get understandably hyped up over its tantalising array of impeccable BBQ meats.

Pork features front and centre here, and we encourage guests to go whole hog. Grab a few friends and partake in the signature 8 Colours Set, where thick strips of pork belly are marinated eight different ways, with wine, ginseng, garlic, miso, and red pepper paste. If you were wondering why the pork here is so rich and tender, it’s because the establishment only uses the famous Mangalitsa pork from Hungary, better known as the ‘Kobe beef of pork’. Searching for something comforting? Then why not order up one of E!GHT’s many stews? Top picks include Beef Kimchi Stew, Seafood Bean Paste Stew, and the Army Stew.

Afterglow,"If there's one relatively underrated cuisine on the Singapore dining scene, it's raw vegan fare. Vegetarianism's stauncher cousin has gained itself a reputation for not being the tastiest stuff in the world, often relegated to the classification of rabbit food. Afterglow, the hip outpost in the Keong Saik area, aims to change that perception with intriguing, creative raw fare that defies expectations.
Afterglow has hippie chic intentions that go well beyond its inventive decor. The concept was born out of local ingredient sourcing and improving the lifestyles of city dwellers with wholesome, natural fare. Evolving the industrial look with a vintage, trinket-filled aura, the communal space is used to showcase on-theme books, accessories and even wines. This is your first indication that the approach here is not all pious, with additional edge given by artisanal cold brew, small-batch coffee, and craft beer to suit the lively neighborhood after dark.
Regardless of your familiarity with raw vegan dishes, the menu at Afterglow aims to please. To start, the Raw vegan nut 'cheese' platter with crackers uses cultured cashews, soaked and pureed to recreate the smooth texture of a cheesy dip, miraculously sans any actual dairy. The accompanying crackers made of whole seeds and grains deliver a satisfying crunch, and the dip is so tasty that you'd never know it has added probiotic benefits. The sushi-like Afterglow kimchi nori rolls uses faux rice made with almonds and homemade Kimchi that has been stewing in zingy marinades for 7 days. Venturing into Mexican territory, the Raw taco bowl substitutes the seasoned beef for chunky walnuts spiced with a blend of salsas and crunchy purple cabbage, for a refreshing take on usually belt-busting burritos. For a more Italian spin, the Raw lasagne smartly deceives the tongue with zucchini as the pasta sheets, and macerated tomatoes as the sauce.
The Drag-pom salad is ideal for raw-vegan newbies and naysayers alike, featuring an undeniably good combination of dragonfruit with pomegranate, avocado, and macadamia. Also sure to please any palate is the Raw chocolate salted caramel fudge, featuring raw avocado and cacao, layered with sesame-based tahini cream, and a vanilla-medjool sweetened crust for a delightfully guilt-free treat. And really, doesn't that make it all the sweeter?

Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments,"In our minds, a culinary gem hidden in plain sight would be the best way to describe Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments. Synonymous with its Italian name, 'the Village', this unpretentious Italian Trattoria situated along Bukit Timah is known by its fans for its warm service and rustic Italian fare.
Despite its modest interior of dark wood floors and tiled bricks, the food at Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments is second to none. It should come as no surprise though, judging by Chef Mimmo's insistence on using only the freshest ingredients and making most of the dishes from scratch!
Diners are in for a real treat as Chef Mimmo brings his Italian roots to the plate with a range of classic Napoleon dishes such as Parma, Quattro Formaggi and Bufala Pizza - a thin crusted tomato based pizza baked to perfection and topped with arugula, slices of fresh bufala mozzarella and cherry tomatoes.
Fancy some light evening breeze while sipping on a glass of Bordeaux? Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments' al fresco dining area is a hit with its regulars, and it's easy to see why. Imagine enjoying some great Italian food with a glass of wine in hand, while the sun sets in the background. I guess that's what the Italians mean by 'La Dolce Vita'.

Al Forno (East Coast) Italian Restaurant,"A sunny retreat that has been an East Coast staple for 20 years, Al Forno really knows what it's doing when it comes to fresh Italian favourites.
With all the Italian options in Singapore, it's no wonder the competition is stiff enough to see many a restaurant come and go, but Al Forno has stood the test of time and tastiness with a beautifully simple philosophy. Take the freshest Italian ingredients, make dishes that people know and love, and the diners will come. And while it's now a common claim to source ingredients like vine ripened whole tomatoes and peppery parmigiana directly from Italy, Al Forno was the first to do so, with exclusive imports since 1995. That means the dishes here have been tasted, tweaked and perfected so that you can't go wrong with anything on the diligently genuine, yet approachable menu.
The Linguine All' Aragosta, more commonly known as Lobster Linguine, is a house favourite, featuring salty capers and olives punctuating a naturally sweet red sauce made from cherry tomatoes. Succulent chunks of lobster tail and thick noodles of linguine soak up the sauce perfectly. For more of that divine signature sauce, go for the Spaghetti Cartoccio, which is studded with a mix of shelled seafood and baked up in a decadent foil package for two. From the pizzas, the Pizza Con Carne is a knockout, with all forms of meaty deliciousness arranged neatly atop the authentic foldable crust. The Pizza Rollo is a great starter or family pick, featuring a melt of ricotta, spinach and ham all rolled up. Looking quite charming atop their trademark checkered tablecloths, all the dishes taste as good as they look!

Al-Sanobar Lebanese Restaurant,"An authentic taste of Lebanon. That's what Al-Sanobar Lebanese Restaurant promises diners who find themselves supping at their bustling restaurant on Bussorah Street, and boy, do they deliver. From familiar staples like falafel, hummus and baklava, to heartier mains like moussaka and lamb kofta, Al-Sanobar Lebanese Restaurant uses quality ingredients and traditional cooking methods to deliver one memorable meal.
What's more, given that most dishes are grilled, baked, or sautéed in olive oil, you don't have to worry about overindulging.
Their cosy home in one of Singapore's oldest, and most vibrant, cultural neighbourhoods, makes complete sense given their desire to impress with traditional flavours with a touch of modern flair. The al fresco area is perfect for people-spotting, and paves the way for a picturesque meal given the backdrop of one of Singapore's most ornate religious structures, the Sultan Mosque.
Excellent use of traditional flavours and beautiful presentations in an even more spectacular surrounding, Al-Sanobar Lebanese Restaurant is the perfect place to take a bite out of both delicious nosh and history.

Alati Divine Greek Cuisine,"If you aren’t in the know, the dim and unassuming interiors or covered doorways of the eateries along Amoy might baffle and leave you wondering if there really are plenty of food options here – perhaps one of the reasons why the bright spaces of ALATI will inevitably catch your eye. From the invitingly open arched doors to the signature blues and whites of the Mediterranean coating the interiors, everything, including the food, will transport you to Greece.

For full authenticity, the produce is brought here, fresh from the Aegean Sea, and items on the menu are crafted by hand, which might explain the depth of flavour in dips like Taramosalata (fish-roe cream) and Melitzanosalata (smoked eggplants with walnuts). Of course, there’s more than pita and dips on the menu. Fill up on amazing Salt-Baked Fresh Fish, grilled gems like the Octopus and Squid – simply named but complex on the tongue – and mains like Kotopoulo Souvlaki (grilled chicken with fried potatoes and yoghurt) as well as Mousaka (minced beef, eggplant, potatoes and béchamel sauce). Even their drinks menu boasts Greek tipples like Mastiha and Ouzo, an uncommon sight in Singapore.

Bring on the influx of Japanese and American diners to our shores, we’re not complaining, but it’s nice to see more unusual cuisines, that prove deliciously authentic, opening up in the heart of the city!

ALBA 1836 Italian Restaurant,"True and blue Italian dining is a dime a dozen in Singapore, but none like ALBA 1836. After many years of collaboration between Matteo Trabaldo Togna and Cm Shih in the financial sector, they decided to invest in the F&B business. Two years ago, their joint passion for food and wine led them towards a project in hospitality and in particular with the first Italian fine dining concept in Singapore.
Idyllically located along the iconic cobblestone pathway known as Duxton Hill, diners are greeted with a bustling colonial setting, indoor and outdoor garden seating, and an ever-changing seasonal menu consisting of only the finest and freshest ingredients to contribute to the fantastic Italian dinner fare.
The set lunch is great too. For only S$28.00, diners can escape work to enjoy three courses of freshly prepared dishes. We tend to opt for the Octopus salad with fennel leaves, the Pan fried black cod on saffron potato puree and broad beans, followed by a hefty serving of their rendition of a Sicilian “Cannoli” with sweet ricotta cheese, candied orange, and chocolate shavings served with pistachio ice cream straight from Bronte. It’s a few delectable bites of bliss before you have to head back to work!

The food here is bold, adventurous, and dead-on delicious, like the upmarket tze-char inspired restaurant you’ve always wanted. Plus, they’ve got a sexy bar called the Laundry Room, accessible from a back alley, for some cheeky pre-dinner drinks and speakeasy vibes before tucking into platefuls of creative nosh.

Think small plates like deep fried Brussels Sprouts served with charred miso and sour cream, or Blood Cockles sauteed Vietnam style and served with chili jam, pork crackling, and caramelized fish sauce. We told you. Mains progress to much funkier territory with numbers like the Belly Mussels, a plateful of crisp roast pork belly served with mussels tossed in a sweet and sour chili sauce, and Snails & Marrow, a marriage of two French comfort foods, escargots and beef bone marrow, paired with sweet shallots and garlic rice. Do not miss the chargrilled Beef Short Ribs, falling off the bone and alive with a dressing of coriander, lime, pickles, and piquant Yemeni skhug (a fiery chili sauce).

The Matcha Maniac is particularly noteworthy for its lush green colour and generous serving of rich chantilly cream. If sugar isn’t your thing, the Pokecado Toast comes in the same lovely green shade, with velvety smashed avocado on sourdough topped with spiced roasted cashews and crispy tempura batter.

Prefer some bubbly? The bar bites are as indulgent as poke is healthy. From Southern Fried Chicken Skin to local favourite Har Cheong Kai starting from just $4, you could be forgiven for wanting to try them all in one sitting. Their Happy Hour deals are pretty darn great as well - an array of $6 bottled beers and cold pints going from $10 and up. In a place like this where both food and drinks appease those at either ends of the clean or indulgent eating spectrum, you'll find solace in knowing it'll hit all the right spots.

Angelina (Marina Bay Sands),"Founded in Austria over a hundred years ago, Angelina tea rooms have been the meeting place of the rich and famous for more than a century. Their client list includes the likes of Coco Chanel and Marcel Proust - this is the perfect place to be if you want to see and be seen, while dining on some dainty pastries, of course.

Angelina’s most famous offering is undoubtedly the L’Africain Hot Chocolate. Made with a mix of cocoa from Niger, Ghana, and the Ivory Coast, this historic drink comes with whipped cream, and is warm, creamy and subtly sweet. Pair this rich drink with one of their crisp pastries or airy cakes. The Paris New-York is made with choux pastry and chestnut.

The Mont Blanc is a combination of meringue, chestnut puree and cream, this dish is light, soft, and Instagram-worthy. Chestnut puree is piped delicately on top of the meringue to create a mound which can easily be dug into with a spoon. Made with a recipe that has been a secret since its inception, it’s no wonder this dish is one of their most popular items.

Diners looking for something a little moreish can opt for the mains here, which are just as delicious as the desserts and pastries on offer. The Chilli Crab Pasta is a hot favourite. Made with homemade chilli crab sauce and tossed with a generous helping of crab meat.

Decorated with elements inspired by the French neoclassical period, and with ornate finishings covered in carvings of garlands and ribbons, Antoinette is perfect for an afternoon of sophistication and luxury.

Meticulously crafted pastries and Parisian bistro favourites are the highlights of the extensive menu. Top of the list for most diners is the Classic French Onion Soup - caramelised onions are stewed in a rich chicken and veal broth, and topped with a cheese crust. Served with a slice of cheese toast, this aromatic soup is rich in flavour, making it a savoury delight.  Another great choice is the Tartine Tartiflette. A grilled, open-faced sandwich of Levain bread, onions, smoked bacon, potatoes, Reblochon cheese and fried egg, this dish is so utterly divine that it should not come as a surprise if you are asked to share it among your group of friends! If you’re in the mood for something sweet, the Chocolicieux sweet crêpe is definitely not to be missed. Comprising warm chocolate sauce drizzled over 60% dark chocolate ice cream, creamy chocolate pieces, and served with a generous dollop of vanilla crème Chantilly, this is truly every chocoholic’s dream come true!

Ashino,"Hidden away from the rip-roaring CHIJMES lies Ashino, a cosy ten-seater restaurant that successfully recreates the experience of dining in a bespoke sushi restaurant in Tokyo. And no details have been spared here, from the decor that features a sushi counter fashioned from a 180-year-old block of hinoki cypress wood to the imported ingredients flown in from Japan.

Heading this restaurant is none other than Taku Ashino, whose precision and meticulousness help elevate the delicate ingredients them spectacular. Having trained in various sushi restaurants in Tokyo for over a decade, Ashino pays careful attention to making the ingredients sing, grilling his fish over a binchotan grill instead of a gas torch, as well as cooking a blend of Hokkaido and Niigata rice in a traditional iron rice pot with Mount Fuji water to achieve the perfect texture of rice.

Whether you choose a set or omakase menu for lunch, rest assured that you’ll be in good hands. Signature sushi classics make an appearance, from the delectable melt-in-your-mouth Fatty Tuna to the Fresh Salmon Roe that provide bursts of flavour when you bite down on it, leaving you with nothing but a smile on your face.

Eschewing ostentatiousness and swankiness, Ashino is a culinary gem that delivers up delectable sushi not to be found anywhere else in this city.

At Awfully Chocolate cafes, we serve our desserts the way we believe they should be experienced.

Bakerzin @ United Square,"Long before the macaron craze and the fancy French names that now dot our culinary landscape, Bakerzin was already introducing Singaporeans to the wonders of a oozy Warm Chocolate Cake or rich Chocolate Soufflé. Authentic techniques, impeccable execution, and a welcoming setting has established this homegrown brand as a go-to dessert place for everyone.
The brand offers more than just dessert though. The stunning menu (that would look at home on any coffee table) also showcases a mouth-watering spread of savoury items, all subtly elevated by Bakerzin’s strengths: fresh ingredients executed with a dose of passion & creativity. The Signature Burger sits on a homemade bun that’s a fluffy attraction in and of itself, and Mum’s Chicken Curry lives up to the name. Comforting, familiar, and delicious.

BAM! Restaurant,"We weren't certain it could be done, but BAM! has updated the staid tapas trend back to its former glory, with loud Japanese flavours turning up the volume on dishes that have been there, and done that a few times over. With a hip culture tailor-made for Tras Street, BAM! hits all the high notes.
Merging two cuisines is hardly groundbreaking, however BAM!'s inspired blending of Spanish tapas with small plates that are meant to be shared, and a Japanese sake-flowing izakaya, is spot on. The category is a bit hazy - is it a tapakaya? sakapas? - but whatever you choose to call it, the dining experience here is nothing short of uproarious.
The digs are adequately cool kid-chic, with the requisite hipster trimmings of concrete and not much else. Nude bulbs and the underbelly of the dining room's wiring are starkly exposed. Despite the naked decor, BAM! is not blushing at all with a boldly confident gastronomic vision and spot-on flavours. The vibe draws on the hearty camaraderie of Spanish bars with the real world grit of izakayas, for a pitch-perfect air of laidback dining.
The menu reads like a daily market billboard, hailing the freshest and peak-season ingredients. There are some mainstays though that have earned their permanent placement. The Pasta a la Plancha with Prawn and Sake Butter is next-level umami, with just enough acidity from the wine. And sake doesn't just make a one-time appearance, with a glassed-in cooler of both popular and hard-to-find brands. The resident sake sensei will not only pair your dishes with ample pours, but will show you how to really make the most of it, encouraging you to drizzle the wine into the luscious Kampong Egg with crispy squid and punchy chorizo, another menu regular.
As its name suggests, BAM! is loud and proud of its excellent fusion angle. The hip setting, top-notch food, and unique sake spin, make it deserving of its exclamation point.

The Banana Leaf Apolo (Parkway Parade),"The restaurant Banana Leaf Apolo really needs no introduction. Since its doors opened in 1974, Banana Leaf Apolo has seen its business take off into the stratosphere, welcoming throngs of famished diners on a daily basis.

At its expansive three-shophouse establishment on Race Course Road, Banana Leaf Apolo seats up to 300 people at one go, so it’s a great venue for large family gatherings or catch-up lunches with close friends. And as it befits its name, all the food is served on a banana leaf, a traditional setting that traces its roots back to India. Tuck into signature standouts such as the crimson-coloured Apolo Fish Head Curry. This spice-laden curry stew features a large fresh fish head alongside assorted vegetables such as okra, tomatoes, and eggplant. Another noteworthy dish is the Mutton Mysore, where tender cubes of mutton are tossed in ground Indian spices and cooked to perfection. Then wash your meal down with Apolo Lime Juice where freshly pressed lime juice is mixed with a tinge of sugar syrup for a hint of sweetness.

With its affordable prices, delectable cuisine,  and friendly service, Banana Leaf Apolo has won accolades from food critics and has firmly entrenched itself as a longstanding culinary staple for all Singaporeans.

Bao Boy,"Joining the patty action in town is Bao Boy, the latest opening by chef Andrew Walsh of Cure and Butcher Boy. Fronted by a neon-lit #IncrediBAO sign and dressed in textured concrete walls and brass tones, this trendy restaurant fits right in with the busy Hong Kong Street.

The menu is inspired by burgers, but crafted with the Asian steamed bun (bao). The fluffy white bread is filled with a variety of interesting combinations, from the vegetarian Chickpea Falafel Bao to the Lamb Bao. The former shows off a crunchy patty with a soft, creamy middle, topped with a nutty house-fermented harissa sauce and sesame tahini. Fans of Vietnamese food should try the Pulled Pork Banh Mi Bao — deliciously-marbled Iberico pork jowl is cooked until meltingly tender, then topped with a rich and creamy liver parfait, drizzled with spicy sriracha.

Besides the signature bao, Bao Boy also serves up a selection of snacks for pre-dinner nibbles. Try the Salmon Tartare Nachos, a bright and vibrant dish of fresh fish dressed in a tangy marinade, with crisp tortilla chips for crunch.

Wash down your dinner with an ice-cold beer from the drinks list of premium brews, or savour a wickedly potent cocktail such as the Ryokucha, featuring roasted green tea-infused gin with Campari and a splash of vermouth.

Bar Canary,"A well-kept secret among the well-heeled bar mavens of the city, Bar Canary offers breezy boozing and exceptional offers on drinks and boozy pops that are a rare find in its Orchard neighbourhood.
Take the lift at Grand Park Orchard up a few floors to Bar Canary and you can nearly imagine yourself as the petite bird it's named after. Rather than soaring high above the sparkling city, with knee shaking views of the ground below, you perch happily on the fourth floor for a similarly sunny outlook without the extra fuss that comes with extra altitude. Here the vibe is laid back, as you literally lean upon low slung, canary yellow deck seating. The efficient bar is backed by a glowing BC sign, and serves up suitably strong champagne, cocktails, and boozy pops that any boozehound would approve of. The air is often filled with DJ spun beats, working with warm yellow lighting dripping from wires to set the mood for a fun, fierce, and relaxed evening out.

Bar-Roque Grill,"Bar-Roque Grill at the Amara Hotel is the actualisation of a dream many years in the making. Chef Stephane Istel was determined to open his own restaurant by the time he was thirty-five years old, and the food on offer at the modern rotisserie and bar provides an intimate insight into the experiences that have made the man.
The heart of the menu, of course, is made up of the meats from the rotisserie. Both the French Free Range Chicken and Australian Pork knuckle have won rave reviews, and we could definitely understand why. But don't fixate on just those items though, because while the rotisserie may be the heart, Chef Stephane's deft touch and heartfelt recipes are the soul of what's on offer. Whether it be the tarte flambee, signature to his home town of Alsace, or his mother's apple pie recipe, there's a delicate balance of tradition and modernity in the food and the decor that makes the entire experience undeniably unique.
And when you finally look up from your empty plate, sated and satisfied, contemplate the open kitchen and the stoic, rustic materials of stone, wood, and cement. There's a soft harmony to the design that maintains an elegant poise, a perfect mirror to the generous food served by Chef Stephane paired with the impeccable service directed by manager Kori Millar. It's a restaurant born of dreams, love, and togetherness, and their motto, ""Love on the Plate"" couldn't be any more apt.

The Beast,"For a heaping serving of Southern charm in Singapore, there's no place like The Beast off Arab Street. Featuring artisan Bourbon flights and stick-to-your-ribs soul food, it's sure to tame your beast of an appetite.

Wrapped around a corner of Jalan Klapa, The Beast is a pint-sized space with gallons of flavour. Kick-started by local entrepreneur Jamie Koh of The Chupitos Bar fame, the barn-like eatery is an ode to her college days in Atlanta, Georgia. And some fun times those must have been, judging by the heavy influence of Kentucky-sourced bourbon whisky, including their signature and self-explanatory Baconator shot. The narrow ground floor area is raw and rustic, save for a trendy marquee sign along the inner wall. You could also opt for a roomier dining area upstairs, or for an alfresco barrel-topped table along the walking path.

While it's a space built for fun times and honky-tonk, the food takes its tradition of Southern hospitality very seriously. You'd be hard-pressed to find such true-blue Southern specialties as fluffy buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy and Cajun-spiced shrimp and grits anywhere else in the city, let alone such superb versions. Though the reputation for Southern fare starts with fried chicken and ends with extra butter (Paula Deen-style), The Beast features a complete array of the diverse flavours for which the region is so popular for. If you haven't tried these dishes before, consider this your warning that this stuff is habit-forming, and though not diet-friendly, definitely worth the splurge.

Go for their new brunch menu, when those fresh-from-the-oven biscuits are on display, stuffed with drool-worthy fillings like crispy battered chicken and slow cooked pulled pork. Also noteworthy are the classic Chicken & Waffles, the Mac & Cheese Burger and savoury Cornbread. Washed down with icy Sweet Tea, or all you can drink Mimosas at $30, that's some really good eatin' y'all!

Bella Pasta,"An offshoot of the immensely popular Bella Pizza, its sister restaurant next door, Bella Pasta takes the pizza kitchen’s fine nose for good flavour, steady Italian-trained hands, and generous love for everything rich and creamy, and dishes out a heavy-hitting menu of delicious pasta plates.

If you’ve ever chowed down on the deluxe pizzas at Bella Pizza, you know you’re in for a treat. Here, there’s a full Italian menu including pastas and charcoal grilled meats, turned out by a highly-trained team of chefs drawn from top Italian restaurants all over the island. Dine alfresco to really soak up the Robertson Quay vibes, but also because pasta tastes better with a side of people watching - and you’ll be doing a lot of people watching, because one plate won’t be enough. Think chewy batons of Cavatelli pasta tossed with wilted spinach and salty Parma Ham or a bountiful Linguine Frutti de Mare, a garlicky toss-up of linguine and tender shrimp, clams, and squid. One of the highlights is a beautiful, generous portion of Pappardelle Boscoiala, ribbony strips of pasta in a rich, tomato-based mushroom sauce. Beyond pasta, fill up on their hefty charcoal grilled meats and seafood.

Bella Pizza,"Along Robertson Quay, which overflows with one great foodie option after another, this winning pizzeria stands out for its excellent gourmet-inflected pizzas, made lovingly with Italian ingredients and exacting Italian taste. Grab a seat in the alfresco area and you could almost be on a Roman street, soaking up the sights, sounds, and, most importantly, smells. Here, the pizza is made fresh by hand in the Neapolitan style, meaning the crust has the perfect balance between chewiness and crispiness. That sweet spot is probably why the pizzas here are regularly touted amongst some of the best in town. Obviously it’s not just about the crust: imagine the sinful appeal of a pizza crowned by wobbly mounds of creamy Burrata cheese, or topped with an elegant fan of thinly sliced salmon on a bed of spinach. If all that’s too rich, reach for the bright flavours of anchovies, capers, and tomatoes in their Napoleon pizza, or the simple pleasures of Gorgonzola, browned onions, and Mozzarella in the Pizza Cipolla. There’s also pastas, like the especially indulgent Truffle-bomb, Fettuccine Salciccia Fe Tartufo, where noodles are tossed in a truffle cream, topped with freshly-shaved black truffle. It’s very hard to top the joy of pizza, but here it becomes an art.

Birds of a Feather,"It’s easy to mistake Birds of a Feather for yet another pretty cafe. The space is filled with natural light from two air-well openings, and hand-crafted art pieces and copper pipes are a chic finish to the walls here.

But the dishes here are far from the typical Eggs Benedict or pancake stack. Instead, the food is a delicious fusion of Western with Sichuan influences. Take the Yuxiang (fish fragrance). The sauce is traditionally made by frying doubanjiang, garlic and ginger with pickled chilli, served with meaty eggplants. At Birds of a Feather, the same dish comes with an extra layer of mozzarella cheese, and a generous sprinkle of mantou crumbs.
If you’re a big fan of spicy food, items like the Fortune Skewers are a must-order. This crowd favourite has gotten a new twist, and now comes with a fiery Sichuan red oil. Birds of a Feather specially pick their spices from Chengdu’s spice market, and these are laboriously  fried with chillies to create this house-made oil.

Not all Sichuan dishes are numbingly spicy, either. The Sichuan Oxtail Soup is a light, clear broth, akin to the familiar pig’s trotters soup. Chinese herbs and fresh leek infuse this comforting soup with plenty of flavour.

Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse,"Traditional Tuscan sharing steaks and authentic Italian cuisine.
“Bistecca” is Italian for steak. Bistecca Tuscan Steakhouse's signature dish, and namesake, is the Bistecca alla Fiorentina — a thick cut, char-grilled T-bone steak to share.  Prepared in traditional Tuscan style over a high temperature wood-fired grill to produce a charred crust yet tender and juicy centre for an indulgent steak experience.
Singapore’s favourite Italian steakhouse has been reimagined with a stylish new look at 26 Mohamed Sultan Road, right next door to its previous location, five minutes from the CBD. The heritage features of the century-old shophouse evoke a warm Italian farmhouse feel with exposed brick walls and wood paneling.
Slip into a cozy leather booth and experience unmatched, intimate dining by candlelight with impeccable service, or treat your guests to a modern Tuscan feast at the Chef’s table, adjacent to the open-design kitchen.

The new space brings together elements of Greek mythology and design along with Singapore's Chinese heritage and its colonial past.

The patterns also strike a familiar tone with designs seen in ancient China as well as Singapore's black-and-white houses. It's a marriage of culture that will make you feel at home as you settle for a culinary adventure a world away.

And don't even get us started on their Wok Fried Kagoshima Wagyu Beef Tenderloin served with peppercorn. Using half-cooked well-marbled beef which is then put into a heated stone bowl to finish cooking, get ready for a piping hot bowl of deliciousness.
To end the meal opt for one of their unique dessert choices. The Lemon Gelo served with a lime sorbet, one of our favourites, is a refreshing treat. With an invigorating citrus punch and a sweet jelly base, it's one dessert you'll be craving for days to come!

The nautical-themed decor’s sure to get you in the mood for some delish seafood.

Singapore’s world-renowned chilli crab is given due respect here with its thick, luscious gravy that’s not too sweet and not too spicy. Don’t forget to scoop up all that precious sauce with some fried mantous! Other uber fresh delights include the Signature Sarawak Black Pepper Crab, the Spiced Salt Red Grouper Fish Head, and the irresistible Mala Small Lobster. The Beijing Crispy Duck’s strictly not in the seafood department, but is executed well nonetheless, with a crisp, aromatic skin and some juicy, succulent meat that sure does not disappoint.

Still not sure what to order? Maybe the restaurant’s resident robot, Lucy, can help.

boCHINche,"boCHINche in the city’s foremost Argentine restaurants, bringing the robust hearty cuisine of Argentina to a country that isn’t terribly familiar with its flavours and traditions. Located along sexy Amoy Street, the little quartier of the city that’s leading Singapore’s culinary revolution, the restaurant provides a great mix of laid back lounge vibes and upmarket dining experiences. In other words: sexy cocktails and delicious food. The menu brings the traditional fare of an Argentine bistro to the table, but gives it a modern makeover. One thing that remains, though, is the pride of place given to the custom-made wooden charcoal grill that infuses everything it touches with its signature smoky kiss.

So what is Argentine food? Think croquettes studded with smoky, spicy Chorizo, smoked peppers, and slices of duck ham served with preserved cherries and a cream of pecorino cheese. Classic Argentine empanadas come stuffed with braised cuttlefish, fragrant fennel, and chorizo, or savoury-sweet goat’s cheese with spinach, raisins, and pine nuts. Seafood mains are the next order of business, with plates like charcoal-grilled octopus served with crunchy fennel, new potatoes & samphire salad, and a homey tuna mayo. Argentine beef, the pride of the nation and, indeed, of this kitchen, comes in the form of the Caracu, a beef & marrow bone burger paired with braised ox cheeks, and a piquant salad of tomatoes, onions, and house pickles. For dessert, there’s none other than the fabled Dulce de Leche Creme Brulee & Banana Split Ice Cream, a combination of some of childhood’s favourite flavours: sweet toffee and creamy banana. Or maybe just wind down with one of the bar’s famous cocktails, like the boCHINche Sour, made from Amaretto-like Disaronno, apricot brandy, and lemon juice for a smooth and potent end to the meal. This is a gourmet experience close to the heart of Singapore’s new culinary wave, shot through with an Argentine love of good food, fine wines, and long, luxuriant dinners.

Bodacious,"The joy of good American food is a combination of big flavours, honest-to-god generous portions, and lots of smoky, off-the-grill goodness. That’s the deal here at Bodacious, and the name describes pretty much everything about this place, from its glitzy and contemporary diner vibe to its menu of meaty burgers, pastas, and steaks. Here, breakfast means sidling up to a hulking platter of meatballs served up with baked eggs seasoned with zingy harissa, or the restaurant’s signature Eggs Benedict, a plate overflowing with globes of hollandaise-topped poached eggs, smoked salmon, juicy grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, and English muffins. Later in the day, burgers, including a particularly delectable Tofu Burger, fly out of the kitchen, followed swiftly by nifty twists on classic Western plates like battered cod with sweet potato chips and a salted egg yolk dip, or a flower-clam studded spaghetti tossed in piquant laksa sauce. A juicy Tenderloin Steak & Fries, as well as a crisp-skinned Duck Confit, round up this menu of Western favourites, and if you’re audacious enough, you can finish it all off with a thick serving of Shibuya Toast loaded with salted butter and ice cream. Bodacious food, generous portions, and a food baby to nurse on the way home: don’t say we didn’t warn you!

The Boiler (Esplanade),"The Boiler brings the concept of the American seafood boil to its second outlet at the Esplanade, complete with all the traditional spices, side dishes, cracking crustaceans and a stroke of culinary genius called the Lobsicle.
There's casual, and then there's Boiler-style casual. The kind of casual that lets you get down and dirty, in the tastiest way possible, with your meal. The Boiler features a laidback set up, allowing you to choose your fresh seafood to be boiled to order. You can go a la carte, but the Bombdiggity Bag with Dungeness crab, prawns, mussels, sausage and corn offers tons of bang for your buck. Next, choose a sauce ranging from slightly piquant to can't-feel-your-lips spicy. Your sack of goodies is prepared and then poured directly onto the paper-topped table. Formality is tossed aside along with the shells as you dig in to get to every nook and cranny of the succulent seafood, taking the phrase ""finger-licking good"" very literally. Bibs are included.
Located near the tourist attractions like the Singapore Flyer and Merlion, The Boiler is a real find for lunch, when the usual seafood feast is fine-tuned to the mid-day meal. Tidy but still decadent dishes like Fish & Chips, the Ultimate Burger with caramelized onions, and Prawn Pasta Soup are great options. Any-time sides like the succulent fried Lobsicle on a stick, Sweet Potato Fries, and Momma's Scoop with an indulgently cheesy dip, are all worth the calorie splurge.

The Botanic Restaurant,"Despite being located in one of Singapore’s busiest malls, this restaurant is a world away from its hustle and bustle. From the airy skylights to the natural wood furnishings, everything about The Botanic is carefully curated to create a restorative atmosphere for guests. Diners looking for an escape from the rush of city life are sure to rejuvenated by the innovative experience here.

The menu here focuses on fresh, eco-friendly produce, and using a mix of Western and traditional Asian techniques to bring out the natural flavours of ingredients. A prime example would be the Sambal Smoked Short Rib, a delicious dish inspired by Indonesian cuisine and cooked smokehouse-style. This dish is spicy, sweet, and melts in the mouth from the first bite. Prefer something a little less meaty? Opt for the Grilled Halloumi - made with a generous serving of grilled chunks of cheese with tangy pomegranate molasses and heirloom tomatoes, this dish is not only pretty to look at, but delicious as well.

For a sweet treat to finish up, opt for the Mediterranean Baklava. Soft and airy pieces of pastry served with pomegranate and strawberries - this dish is light, simple, and will leave you wanting more long after the last bite.

Botanico at The Garage,"Nestled within the Botanic Gardens, Singapore’s only UNESCO Heritage site, Botanico has enchanted diners with its beautiful 1920s Art Deco conserved architecture with its lush indoor hall and air-cooled outdoor garden terrace bar, surrounded throughout by greenery.

With dishes served bistro-style, Botanico is rooted in contemporary European methodology and integrated with Asian inflexions with Singaporean Chef Sujatha Asokan bringing her distinctive voice and the stories she sees in the ingredients, some of which are grown in the Botanic Gardens, to the table.

Dishes that encapsulate Chef Sujatha Asokan’s ‘ideology’ of seamless East-West synergy include the Seabass Ceviche, a blend of the zingy citrus of cold ceviche with the spicy tanginess of assam laksa, cooled with savoury shrimp paste ice cream and scented with ginger flower. Botanico’s Iberico Char Siew is another dish that is not to be missed - the top loin is smoked, chargrilled and accompanied by carrot ‘noodles’, carrot puree and honey pork jus that not only goes well with the 30 premium wine labels (all rated 90 points and above by the Wine Spectator) that are available by Coravin, but also with their signature botany-inspired tipples such as the Garage Gin’onic or the Thyme Lemonade.

At Botanico, the dishes and cocktails are crafted to tell stories of botanical adventure, evoking emotion and igniting the imagination and making the experience come alive through the palate and the mind.

Brasserie Les Saveurs,"When it comes to old world charm and turn of the century opulence, nobody does it quite like the St Regis. And nothing harkens to the good old days of the big city hotel like a magnificent French restaurant. Brasserie Les Saveurs is the resident restaurant of the St Regis and is a stunning chamber festooned with gold trim, velvet drapes, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a beautiful crystal chandelier bearing witness to the intimate goings-on below. Expect nothing less than the most traditional and time-honoured of French plates. Kick off with some bubbly and oysters from its raw bar, a selection of different regional oysters from around the world, served with tart vinaigrette. Follow that up with one of its elegant entrees, like a notoriously tricky to prepare Foie Gras Au Torchon, a roll of foie gras coated with pistachios and apricots, and served with brioche. Or a plate of vivid Red Beetroot Gnocchi, tender little mounds served with nutty browned butter, black truffle, macadamia nut, and a foam of goat’s cheese.

And that’s just the entrees! The mains here are a selection of the finest regional plates from France. Think a beautiful cocotte of Seafood Bouillabaisse, filled with tantalizing seafood like monkfish, scallop, mussels, and prawn, perfumed with aromatic fennel, and served with a fiery rouille of garlic and peppers. Nothing gets more traditionally French than a delicate Whole Dover Sole Meuniere, one of the great classics of the repertoire, the creamy-fleshed sole browned in butter before being blanketed in a tart lemon-butter sauce, coated with piquant capers and haricots verts. Red meat here comes in the form of rack of lamb, herb-crusted and served on a bed of heady morels and a Provençal corn galette, as well as an Oven-Roasted Breast of Duck, served “à l’Orange” over a bed of sweet turnips. For a super premium dinner, choose from an entire menu of various aged wagyu steaks, prepared in the classic French style with lots of butter, herbs, and a serving of potatoes. If you’ve got room for dessert, zoom in for the Chocolat “Millefeuille,” an indulgent confection that explodes in your mouth with a range of textures and an unbeatable bittersweet finish. If you’re going to go French, indulge a little and go the whole mile at this old world charmer.

Brotzeit German Bier Bar & Restaurant (Katong),"Since its inception in 2006, Brotzeit German Bier Bar & Restaurant has emerged as a culinary force to be reckoned with. Loved for spinning up authentic German meals and ice-cold beers, Brotzeit can often be seem packed with the food-loving, beer-guzzling crowd at all hours of the day.

There’s nothing more German than huge swirling hunks of sausage. So there’s little surprise to see Brotzeit featuring a wide array of such sausages, the showstopper being the Thuringer Pork Sausage, which comes with a generous heaping of mashed potatoes, sauerkraut, and sweet onion sauce. But the Sausage Platter, another fan fave, serves all the top hits from the kitchen, from grilled pork, spicy chicken, to the garlic pork sausages.

Want something other than sausages? Then have your pick of hearty dishes that include the traditional Goulash Soup, so authentic any German grandmother would approve of it. Featuring generous chunks of tender beef in a herb-tinged soup, this soup is perfect on a rainy night. And the Crispy Oven Roasted Pork Knuckle is another must-try. A Brotzeit staple, this pork shank is oven-roasted until it achieves its fork-tender perfection with a crispy layer of crackling skin to boot. And wash your meal down with a beer or two, and you have all the ingredients for what is just about to be your next perfect meal.

Loved for spinning up authentic German meals and ice-cold beers, Brotzeit can often be seem packed with the food-loving, beer-guzzling crowd at all hours of the day.

There’s nothing more German than huge swirling hunks of sausage. So there’s little surprise to see Brotzeit featuring a wide array of such sausages, the showstopper being the Thuringer Pork Sausage, which comes with a generous heaping of mashed potatoes, sauerkraut, and sweet onion sauce. But the Sausage Platter, another fan fave, serves all the top hits from the kitchen, from grilled pork, spicy chicken, to the garlic pork sausages.

Want something other than sausages? Then have your pick of hearty dishes that include the traditional Goulash Soup, so authentic any German grandmother would approve of it. Featuring generous chunks of tender beef in a herb-tinged soup, this soup is perfect on a rainy night. And the Crispy Oven Roasted Pork Knuckle is another must-try. A Brotzeit staple, this pork shank is oven-roasted until it achieves its fork-tender perfection with a crispy layer of crackling skin to boot. And wash your meal down with a beer or two, and you have all the ingredients for what is just about to be your next perfect meal.

Brunches Cafe,"Trying to look for Brunches Café but can’t seem to find it? No worries - spot the unique 4-seater sofa set converted from an original vintage Mini Cooper!  Decorated with all sorts of retro knick-knacks and furnishings, Brunches Café is a vintage-themed café that specialises in delicious breakfast food, gourmet sandwiches, and great beverages.

The stars of the show are definitely the all-day breakfast items. The Fluffy Pancake Stacks fly out of the kitchen and into the stomachs of ravenous diners - perfectly soft, deeply flavoured and the best start to the lazy weekend, these pancakes are served with sweet seasonal fruits, fresh butter and addictive maple syrup. The Eggs Benedict is not to be missed either - 2 beautifully poached eggs with runny centres are placed atop a bed of Arugula leaves and a generous serving of streaky bacon. The homemade hollandaise sauce poured over the bouncy eggs manages to get the proportion of egg yolk, liquid butter, water, and lemon juice exactly correct, resulting in a dish that is soul-satisfying! As for the desserts, the Molten Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream is nothing short of amazing. Warm, liquid chocolate oozes out from the centre of the mini chocolate cake when cut open, complemented perfectly by the ice-cold vanilla ice cream.

Buko Nero,"Mention to Singapore foodie friends that you have found a tiny down-to-earth place where, for the past 16 years, the owners themselves have put their own Asian twist on mind-blowingly amazing Italian food, and it’s likely that the name Buko Nero will pop up. One-of-a-kind in terms of its compact dynamism, Buko Nero prides itself on serving food that they themselves would want to eat, if they were the customer. The wife, Tracy, who is Singaporean, handles the front of the restaurant, while the husband, Oscar, an Italian, is the chef. Together, they have created something that is semi-legendary in the Singapore dining scene because of the quality of food and the waiting list for this restaurant.

Top of the list of recommendations for this unique establishment is the Buko Nero Tau Kwa Tower with sauteed vegetables and Asian dressing, which was created as a stacked dish consisting of vegetables such as parsley, carrots, and enoki mushrooms layered atop a big piece of tau kwa (firm tofu). Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soya sauce) is drizzled over it, giving the entire concoction an extra oomph. Deceptively simple, this dish has won fans because of its unique flavour combination and freshness of vegetables used. The Baked Fillet of Cod, which is presented with a crust made of olives and a sweet bell pepper coulis, has also won praise for its simple yet effective use of basic ingredients. For cosy Italian fare in the heart of Singapore, it is hard to find a more intimate, homely dining experience than this well-loved restaurant that serves food straight from the heart.

Chef Gabriele Piegaia is an old hand at the Singapore restaurant scene, honing his skills in Michelin-starred kitchens across Italy, then learning the nuances of the Singaporean palate at Senso, Hotel Michael, and most recently, as the executive chef of Alkaff Mansion. Adhering to the golden rule of ""what you see on the menu is what you see on the plate"", the signature dishes are authentic, direct, and robust.

Butcher Boy,"Relish the relaxed, casual vibe at Butcher Boy; this meat-lover’s haven is one to visit for its tasty, Asian-inspired cocktails, good music, and its great selection of meaty treats (of course). Named after Chef-Owner Andrew Walsh’s favourite movie The Butcher Boy, the restaurant places its specialty front and centre – and boy is the meat good.
Try not to swoon as you tuck into a helping of Black Angus Tender Valley Rib Eye – tender, luscious, and perfect with a generous slather of the house rendition of XO sauce, it’s an all-round mouthwatering dish that you’ve got to try. You can’t go wrong with the salt-baked and grilled Crispy Skin Pork Belly either – a comforting favourite complete with a good, solid crackling. A sauce would be a lovely touch as well; the restaurant’s list of Asian-influenced sauces are big on taste and serve to perfectly complement the meats. If you’re looking for something that’s not all just meat, however, then don’t forget to peruse the list of baos and sides (think Tomato, Tofu, Onion Dashi). And of course, complete your meal with a drink on the side – the Plum Sloe Gin Fizz is deliciously tangy and a definite must-try, and the Smoking Carriage is an impressive number you do not want to miss!

In the tradition of a true mezza, begin with a sharing platter of some of the most beautiful hummus in town: topped with a party of pine nuts, herbs, minced lamb, and olive oil, this creamy hummus, eaten with crisp pita, is heaven on earth. Alongside that, a mezze platter of Babaganoush, Labneh, Moussaka, and Arabic Salad, gives you extra pita-dipping options, and all this before the main course of grilled meats. From fragrant, smoky Lamb Kofta to tender Shish Taouk (chicken breast in a zesty marinade), nothing speaks of the Middle East quite like its stunning array of grilled, marinated meats. But it’s the charcoal-grilled Lamb Chops, paired with spicy harissa, grilled vegetables, and rice that makes for a truly climactic moment: the smoky, meaty flavours are brought out perfectly by the zingy harissa, and the meat comes off the bone in chewy, tender bites.

Helmed by Executive Chef Kenji Yamanaka, who has built up a formidable gamut of experience with a portfolio that includes stints at three-star Michelin restaurants Georges Blanc in Vonnas, France, and L’Osier in Ginza, Tokyo, this charming eatery has earned several accolades including the prestigious 1-Michelin Star.

Chef Kenji's thoughtfully crafted discovery menus feature fresh produce, with meats and fish sourced and flown in from artisanal producers in Japan, and seasonal fresh vegetables from France. Highlights include Kenji's signature Amadai dish. The Amadai fish from Kyoto Prefecture is cooked in the traditional ""Matsukasayaki"" style where the scales are left on the fish and fried to a crisp resembling pine cones. This gives the fish a very unique combination of crispy and tender textures. While the cooking method remains the same, Chef Kenji comes up with new flavours to pair the Amadai with, based on the season, a reflection of his dedication to the craft.

Bōruto,"Fusion Japanese and Sake galore is what Bōruto delivers. Located a
stone’s throw away from the CBD and styled as a modern day Izakaya,
the double-storey, industrial chic establishment is helmed by Chef
Patrick Tan, owner of Japanese robatayaki restaurant Tamashii Robataya.

The first floor of Bōruto offer foodies a casual dining experience by
dispensing out a plethora of shareable dishes from their
Italian-Japanese menu like Hotate & Kanpachi Carpaccio, thinly sliced
Hokkaido Scallops & Amberjack, and Risotto Croquettes, delicious stuffed
potato croquettes with Tomato Risotto.

the bank that operated in the same premises and the original bank vault,
still functional, sits on the second floor and now securely showcasing
the most premium bottles of Sake available. Here, Sake Connoisseurs can
enjoy the novelty of walking into the Vault, selecting from a range of

Caffe Fernet,"Hurrah, the Jigger & Pony Group have done it again! The brilliant minds behind some of our favourite cocktail spots such as Jigger & Pony, Sugarhall, and Gibson, have created an exciting dining concept that we absolutely adore.
Situated in the historic Customs House by the uber-scenic waterfront, Caffe Fernet is a beautiful 130-seater establishment where Italian-inspired nibbles and drinks are served with style and flair. On good days, we prefer to opt for the casual and breezy alfresco dining area where  we can sip on a drink while enjoying views of the Marina Bay skyline.
The food here promises to be fresh and exciting. Instead of the heavy, traditional Italian nosh, Caffe Fernet takes these tried-and-true Italian flavours and breathes into them fresh life. Indulge in delightful plates such as the minimalistic Cacio e Pepe that showcases nothing but freshly cracked black pepper and high-grade cheese. Looking for finger food instead? Then opt for the delightful morsels of Tomato Poppers or a bowl of Olives. And be sure to order up an evergreen cocktail such as a Spritz or Negroni that never goes out of style.
Whether you’re a food or cocktail aficionado, you won’t regret swinging by Caffe Fernet for a contemporary restaurant and bar experience done right.

Caffé B,"Moving from the glitz of the Marina Bay Sands to the old-world-meets-new-world charm of Club Street, Caffe B is one of the island’s best-kept secrets, loved by regulars for its cocktails and refined Japanese-meets-Italian cuisine. Now the environs are more chill, expanded, and located in one of the trendiest parts of town, which makes it a triply more exciting experience. Kick off a meal here with a sinful Espresso Martini as you wait for your first course to arrive. A dome-shaped Burrata Cheese arrives at the table wobbling with the promise of its creamy insides, best enjoyed mopped up with wedges of heirloom tomatoes on the side. Then there’s the refined Espelette Octopus Salad, featuring grilled octopus legs alongside a piquant and fruity espelette sauce, a Mediterranean flavour combination made in heaven. The ocean theme continues with a plate of grilled King Prawns served atop a bed of crunchy and sweet baby vegetables.

The signature Risotto Singapore features a crown of scallops and uni, the whole dish bathed in a saffron-kissed stock, giving way to creamy, umami mouthfuls, while the Tagliatelle Carbonara features tangles of pasta coated with eggy cream, flecked with bits of truffle and a heady topping of freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. For dessert, nothing short of the Tiramisu, except it’s a deconstructed version featuring a dome of Mascarpone ice cream over a scattering of chocolate and coffee cake, coffee gelee, and raspberry coulis. Sure-handed cuisine, an elegant dining room, and punchy cocktails worth their weight in glassware, this is a worthy addition to the gems along Club Street.

Cajun on Wheels (Plaza Singapura),"It may seem a little counter-intuitive at first, but think of this as a Cajun food truck that’s decided to hang up its wheels and stay put, serving up platefuls of delicious Cajun goodness in a comfy restaurant setting. Louisiana-style seafood is the highlight here, featuring steamed, deep-fried, and baked treasures of the sea given a heavy hit of zesty Cajun spice, and then eaten off a large communal tray for maximum enjoyment. You’ve got the classic Cajun on Wheels Crab, crustaceans drenched in a rich and buttery Cajun sauce, fleshy Lobster & Prawns given a lick of spice the enhance their natural sweetness, and briny Mussels given a quick steam to tenderise their flesh then doused in lashings of fragrant seasoning. Beyond Cajun spices, there’s also creamy sauces like Thai Red Curry and even Salted Egg Yolk to enhance your enjoyment.
If you have a hard time picking your seafood, opt for one of their magnificent platters, the chief of which is the Olympian Bucket, a no-frills metal pail filled to the brim with seafood goodness and crowned with a massive crab with a cheese gratin on its back. For very large parties and appetites, there is the Cajun on Wheels Spread, which features several buckets of seafood, platters of grilled fish, with some burgers slapped on for good measure. The aromas, generosity, and communal-style dining throws you right into the Southwest, where pleasure, greed, and the love of good food are ways of life. Come experience it for yourself at Cajun on Wheels (Plaza Singapura).

Candlenut,"Warm, full-bodied, and complex are often adjectives people use describe the beloved and traditional Peranakan cuisine. At Candlenut, this uniquely Southeast Asian cuisine is getting its time in the limelight thanks to chef-owner Malcolm Lee’s deft work and skill that garnered him a Michelin star two years in a row.

With high ceilings, clean lines, and plenty of sunshine, it’s almost impossible to feel stressed in the relaxed and laidback atmosphere that Candlenut exudes. While this 92-seater establishment includes a private room for more intimate dinners, guests also have the option of sitting in the al fresco area for a night under the stars.

There are a fair number of classic Peranakan dishes on a menu that spans across 40 appetisers, mains, and desserts. Be prepared to fall head over heels for standouts such as the Red Lion Snapper, accompanied by fresh chilli sambal and charred garlic chives. The King Tiger Prawn, featuring local ingredients such as gula melaka coconut sauce, lemongrass, and Thai basil, is also another hit. Of course, indecisive eaters can always go for the playfully-named Ah-Ma-Kase tasting menu to sample a little of everything.

With a new home at the ultra-hip COMO Dempsey, Candlenut promises a night (or afternoon) filled with contemporary Straits-Chinese cuisine amid the lush greenery that is Dempsey Hill.

Captain K Seafood Tower (Middle Road),"It’s no great secret that many Singaporeans are extremely partial towards seafood. It’s an even more blatant reality that a large percentage of Singaporeans have an ongoing love affair with all things Korean. Captain K Seafood Tower combines a selection of luscious seafood, Korean flavours, and an excitingly unusual seafood tower concept to make for a delicious, satisfying dining experience you won’t be forgetting in a hurry.

Choose from three different soup bases: the classic Kombu Dashi base, homemade Korean Kimchi soup base, and Premium Korean Ginseng Chicken soup base. Then, decide on how many tiers you would like for your tower, with a minimum of three tiers and a maximum of nine, and this is where it starts to get really interesting. Delicious helpings of seafood are steamed in each tier from top to bottom (the tiers are stacked on top of the soup base), and the resulting flavourful juices are collected in the base, adding a richness of taste that will prove oh-so-delectable. And don’t forget, you can still dig into a freshly-cooked serving of Blue Mussels, or Crab, or whatever it is you so choose. From Prawns, to Half-Shell Scallops, to Clams, it’s a veritable treasure trove of the fruits of the sea, and as fresh as you please. Quality seafood and hearty, tasty soups – what more could you ask for, really?

Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria (CHIJMES),"Forget the meat-and-potatoes steakhouse. A lively Brazilian churrascaria is what you should seek for an eventful and delicious evening out.

The idea is simple. You sit down, and passadors bearing skewers of grilled premium meat, carve moist slivers directly onto your plate. Beef, chicken, lamb, fish – there's no need to limit yourself. It's an endless flow of meaty goodness where all you have to do is sit, and eat. And eat. And eat. Just when your palate is starting to feel a little jaded, you order a portion of grilled caramelised pineapple whose sharp, tangy sweetness is the perfect way to whet your appetite all over again. All so you can get back to those delicious cuts of meat.

Don't just be dazzled by the succulent barbecued meats, rotisserie-cooked to perfection. There's also a buffet spread that shouldn't be overlooked! With staples like salads and pastas, it's where you should turn to if you feel that you've met your match on the protein front.

The meat though, is undeniably the draw of this restaurant, and with a name like Carnivore, that shouldn't be a surprise.

Stationed near the archways of the iconic CHIJMES pavilion, this Carnivore outlet is undeniably unique. Softened by the backdrop of the gorgeous white chapel, the outdoor dining option here is a must, creating an incomparable ambience that makes this unique dinner experience all the more special. So sharpen those claws and polish those canines my friends, because there's no better place to meet.

In place of exposed brick and traditional white table cloths, Caruso features crisp, white stone arches, an airy bar and dining room, and bright citrus walls. Its concrete floors, sleek furniture and two storey-foyers are modern, while mainstays of Italy are sprinkled about, with poppy Italian tunes playing and vintage photos of the restaurant's namesake singer dotting the wall.
While the interiors exude an air of Southern Italy, the flavours from the dishes that fly out of the kitchens here will truly transport diners to the heart of Puglia at first bite. Start your meal right with La Burrata, Puglia’s renown burrata cheese with wild rocket and cherry tomatoes, or sink your teeth into the beautifully fresh and tart octopus salad Insalata Di Polipo. Follow that with famous lamb dishes that Puglia is famous for: the Pappardelle Con Ragu Di Agnello features slow braised lamb that’s cooked for 8 hours and served over homemade pasta, while Costolette Di Agnello Al Timo brings you gorgeous thyme-roasted lamb chops with artichokes, spinach, and roasted potatoes.

Casa MANINI,"Founded by the grandson of of Lucia and Francesco Manini, this restaurant is a modern reincarnation of Ristorante Manini, one of the most beloved restaurants of Bergamo. The local restaurant does not have the lush four floors of the original restaurant, but the menu is bursting with authentic Italian classics made with love by Fulvio Manini himself.

The Lasagna Classica is the most popular dish on the menu, and for a good reason.

The Pollo Alla Milanese is another beloved classic: breaded chicken thigh is cooked to a tender and crispy perfection, and it’s served with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.

For a sweet treat to end off the meal, opt for the Lava Cake. This decadent chocolate cake with a molten centre that can be broken open with a spoon gently. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that melts into the molten centre, this dish is rich, decadent, and a perfect dish to end the meal. Prefer something less decadent? Try the Affogato - a refreshing shot of espresso with vanilla ice cream - the perfect pick me up after a rich lunch.

Casa Roma Ristorante Italiano,"In Singapore, the best food is always tucked away in hard-to-reach places, and that seems to be the case for Casa Roma, which is hidden away in quiet Bukit Timah, some 15 minutes away from the mania of Orchard Road. The space, done up to resemble a bustling Roman trattoria, is homey, rustic, and welcoming, and a large mural of Roman landmarks reminds you that you’re here to tuck into the hearty food of this storied city.
Here, they offer a traditional multi-course Italian meal, which you kick off with some pasta, like the classic Spaghetti Alla Carbonara and little pillowy Ravioli stuffed with cheese and served with Parma ham, before diving into its meaty mains. Choose from dishes like a crisp-skinned Branzino al Pomodoro, a fillet of bass served with piquant capers and salty anchovies in a light tomato sauce, or a hefty Vitello Al Funghi Porcini, a tender veal loin grilled to perfection then dressed in a creamy porcini sauce, all delicious paired with one of the restaurant’s great beers or wines. A sweet ending is compulsory, so end the night with a Budino Al Latte, a milky creme caramel, or the ubiquitous but irresistible Tiramisu.It’s time to gear up for your very own Roman holiday, transported to Rome not by plane, but by delicious Italian plates.

Cast Iron,"Have you ever fantasized about your favourite sushi and sashimi restaurant sharing the same roof as an amazing Spanish grill? Someone has clearly heard your prayers, because Cast Iron features exactly that - an exquisite Japanese ‘cold bar’ alongside a fiery, smoky Gaucho Grill, and a menu of delicate small plates that spans the range from ocean fresh sashimi and sushi to fresh-off-the-grill cuts of meat, seafood, and vegetables. Whet your appetite with some Japanese whisky or sake, and chow down on a beautifully presented Salmon Spicy Uramaki before pursuing some tender cuts of seasonal sashimi, directly imported from Japanese seafood markets.

Then warm up the palate with some grilled small plates, like an exquisite helping of grilled Razor Clams paired with garlic, chili, shallots and fine herbs, or gamey Quail, brushed with an orange & clove reduction, herbal tarragon, and almonds. An Iberico Pork Chop arrives fresh off the coals with a punchy chorizo chili jam, and crunchy pickled fennel, while Jumbo Prawns are flame-seared and arrive in a French-Thai melange of tarragon, vermouth, and som tam (spicy papaya salad). The other grill items are done Robata style, or “slow-grill” style, to get the best texture out of premium cuts of meat like Iberico Pork, Wagyu, and vegetables like Lady’s Fingers, Hokkaido Corn, and Japanese Sweet Potatoes.

If it’s not clear by now, the philosophy of this restaurant is to take quality produce and give it the barest touch to elevate its natural textures and flavours. Take yourself through an entire sensory experience at Cast Iron, a true gem in Singapore’s already busy dining scene.

Casuarina Curry (MacPherson),"The east has never lacked good prata places, but this will be the new go-to for late night cravings. Serving up over 35 varieties of prata, as well as biryanis, thosais, and murtabaks, and opened till midnight, there’s no better place to gather with your friends for supper. Although this outlet is much smaller than the original in Thomson, it makes for a cosier environment with al-fresco seating options.

The draw of this spot is their unique flavour of prata. The leavened bread dish is soft, tender, and served hot. Most of the pratas come with thick daal to dip into, and make for a memorable meal. Try the Cheese Prata - served piping hot and perfect with the warm spice of the daal. Diners who are feeling a little more adventurous can opt for a non-traditional flavour, like Chicken Floss, or Banana Chocolate.

If you’re dining with just one other person, the set meals are the way to go. Try the Fish Head Set Meal - it comes with rice, drinks, and pappadam, as well as a generous serving of the famed fish head curry. The gravy is tangy and flavourful, and the fish in this dish tends to absorb flavour from the spices used, which give the meat an earthy taste.

Catchfly,"The Singapore cocktail revolution continues with this super-sharp looking and sexy American-style cocktail bar that joins the liquor belt along Ann Siang Street with its menu of expertly hand-crafted cocktails, swinging vibes, and delicious modern bar bites.
The drinks come courtesy of the genius mind of head bartender Liam Baer, and they feature some nifty gourmet touches that make these more than a get-drunk-quick tipple. Think complex numbers like Salad Days, which features summer-ripe tomatoes that are steeped, sous vide, in gin to create a vibrant base that’s layered with grapefruit-kissed liquor, herbal French vermouth, and a touch of smoked olive oil and pink peppercorn for a zany, tomatoey martini that may just be good for you. Then there’s This One Works With Tequila, which takes your choice of spirit (Tequila recommended) and fizzes it up with homemade salted grapefruit soda before being topped with a garnish of cucumber and dill. For something less vegetal, there’s The Honey Badger, a burnished, honeyed sunset of a drink featuring rosemary-infused bourbon, herbal chartreuse, and touches of lemon, ginger, and honey.
With so much herbal flourish in the drinks, you’d be right to guess the food is an all out naughty pigfest: think hearty plates like the Kimchi Beef Chilli & Corn Chips that give you mouthful after mouthful of meaty, spicy indulgence. This well could be one of the sexiest spots along Ann Siang to get your drink game on, plus points if you’re a cocktail nerd and want to experience some exciting new flavours in your crystal-cut glass.

Chachako,"Meet Chachako, a free-spirited and adventurous chef who scours the world to bring home the most glorious grills and fares from all corners.

Chachako's journey began a few years ago. Tired of cooking the same dishes, she picked up her bags and started her quest to look for the best meal in the world. From Asia, Europe to the Americas, her search led her to foods she has never tasted, reclaiming unexpected palates, flavours and sensations.

Soon, she realised that the best meal does not have a label or a nationality; it is simply a good time over food that is cooked with love.
Inspired by her journeys, she created a distinctive blend of Asian-infused, home-style grill that is eclectic, quirky and full of surprises. From spices, recipes to presentation, Chachako wants her food to remind you of a mouth-watering, home-cooked meal that is best enjoyed when it is shared with others.

Chao Chao Gyoza,"If you can’t get enough of these deep-fried delights, there’s finally a place to sate your cravings. Founded in Osaka in 1971, this historic restaurant pays homage to the beloved Japanese dumpling. The recipe was perfected by Kenzo Nishi and the basic ingredients have not been modified since. Every single dumpling is filled with the right amount of filling and is fried to crisp perfection without a hint of greasiness.

The gyoza here are stuffed with a variety of fillings and topped with everything from cheese to citrus sauce. Vegetarians will be glad to know that Cabbage Gyoza is also on the menu. Diners looking for a unique dish can try the Ponzu Buta Gyoza - a delicious serving of pork gyoza drenched in a citrus and ponzu sauce. The combination may sound off-putting to some, but don’t knock it till you’ve tried it. The sharp citrus flavours cut through the richness of the meat and creates a contrast that will leave your taste buds wanting more.

Curious carnivores should opt for the Tebasaki Gyoza - two pieces of chicken stuffed with gyoza meat. The chicken is crisp and flavourful, and when combined with the gyoza filling, this is a dish you’ll want to have seconds of.

Cheval Cafe Bar Bistro,"Named after the French word for horse, this restaurant serves up a range of brunch staples and mains in an upscale setting boasting an expansive view of the rolling greens of the turf club. This is the perfect spot for brunch with friends on the weekends, or a casual lunch date.

The Smoked Salmon Salad is an excellent option for diners who are watching their waistlines. Made with tender pieces of smoked salmon tossed in crunchy greens, this dish is best enjoyed with one of their classic cocktails or the ever-popular Frozen Margarita. Not a fan of alcohol? Fear not, as the mocktail options are just as numerous. We like the Shirley Temple for it’s citrus flavour sweetened by a hint of Grenadine syrup.

For something a little moreish, opt for the Sea Meets Land - the perfect dish for meat and seafood lovers. Think surf n’ turf, but more upscale - this dish is made with treasures from land, like foie gras and ribeye steak, as well as tiger prawns and scallops. This dish is large enough to be shared by two people. Don’t like sharing? Dig into one of their pasta dishes instead. The Crab Meat Marinara Spaghetti is a crowd favourite, and features juicy chunks of crab meat tossed in a tangy tomato sauce.

Chic Good Teh,"This spot creates halal* versions of Teochew dishes for Muslim diners. Located in the Malay food paradise of Geylang, Chic Good Teh is famed for their delicious dishes such as Chicken Tender Soup and Mee Sua.

The most famous dish on the menu would have to be the Chicken Tender Soup - a pork-free version of the classic Bak Kut Teh. Peppery, hearty, and best enjoyed with a bowl of steamed rice, this dish tastes so good, you won’t even notice that it’s made with chicken. Vegetarians also have the option to sip on Vegetable or Seaweed Soup - both dishes are rich in flavour and affordable, at only five dollars a bowl. There are also unique items like Braised Oxtail and Lamb Shank available to order for diners looking for something more than soup.

Diners looking for a unique snack are sure to be delighted by the fried items on offer. Sotong Balls, Cheese Tofu, and Chicken Wing are all available. These hearty items are deep fried to crisp perfection and served hot - the best way to enjoy them! The Chicken Wing is dripped in a special batter before frying, giving it a crisp exterior and soft, tender interior. (Jan 2019)

Chimichanga,"It doesn’t look like much: literally a dusty-looking, bare-walled “cantina” with some upcycled furniture and distressed-looking walls. But that’s the point. Styled as Singapore’s first “Mexican dive bar,” the fuss-free grunge is part of the concept, the vibe is something like a little shack somewhere in the Sonora Desert. The food, though, is anything but sparse. Here, there are tacos, burritos and Mexican rice bowls bursting with the spicy, punchy flavours of one of Singapore’s most popular new cuisines.
There’s the usual holy trinity of tacos, meat, and salsa, with fillings ranging from tender pork carnitas and crispy boracho fish to pulled beef singing with the smoky heat of ancho peppers. Top it up with some rice, beans, and extra salsa and have it wrapped up in a stretchy tortilla for some burrito goodness, or just have all of that in a bowl if you want to keep your fingers clean for when you reach for that bottle of Mexican beer. The eatery’s namesake is the sinful Chimichanga, essentially a burrito that, as if it weren’t indulgent enough, undergoes some deep frying for an insane amount of crunch. Extras here include spicy jalapeno poppers and buffalo wings for group situations where sharing platters are required because, and let’s face it, you’re not going to share that burrito. Wash it all down with heady tequila-based cocktails and you’re all set for the rest of that desert trek, throat a little less parched, tummy a lot less empty.

The Chop House (Katong),"Along East Coast Road, I12 Katong is a gem of a place. It retains the laidback vibe that the East side of Singapore is known for, whilst bringing stellar retail and dining experiences to an area long-known for its Peranakan heritage and old-world charm. The Chop House is one such dining experience. Created by the same team behind the acclaimed Wooloomooloo Steakhouse, The Chop House is a gastro-bar that serves classic feel-good fare and a wide range of ice-cold draught beer.

What makes the Katong branch even more exciting is the addition of a Southbend broiler from the U.S., the same model that sears Wooloomooloo's famous steaks to perfection, to the gastro-bar's kitchen.The Chop House endeavours to serve the freshest ingredients in a hassle-free manner to patrons yearning for a casual and hearty dining experience, so expect a wide choice of appetizers, sizzling grilled meats served off the broiler, and succulent burgers. Diners have raved about their Tomato Burrata and their sambal condiment, which is a perfect pairing with their meat. To round off a perfect meal, there is a wide range of cocktails and five types of ice cold beers on tap.

The Chop House (VivoCity),"There are many things that should never be DIY - haircuts, electrical work, legal representation. However we do live in Singapore, where the do-it-yourself food culture has given us such tasty dining experiences as Korean BBQ, steamboat and even salad bars.
Thus, when we heard of the novel self-tap beer system at The Chop House, we were skeptical on which side of the DIY fence it would fall. Then we tried it, and we are now true believers that draught beer actually tastes better when served oneself, without a mind-numbing wait at a bar. The Chop House offers 6 brew varieties with taps sprinkled about their chic gastro bar space, so you are never more than a few steps away from a cold, refreshing mug.
The self-taps are evident of The Chop House's style - cool, casual and fun. In contrast to its sister restaurant Wooloomooloo Steakhouse in Raffles City, the kitchen puts an innovative spin on meaty classics at very reasonable price tags. Located at VivoCity, the indoor-outdoor locale masters the blend of bar and restaurant, with an open flow of picnic tables, industrial chic lighting and loft-sized windows letting the outside pour in. Each setting includes a classic steak knife, which you will probably need as you get into its varied menu of soups, burgers, steaks and sides that live up to its storied Wooloomooloo reputation.

Chuan Hung,"Chuan Hung’s name is beautifully straightforward belying the respect, thought and care that was put into it, much like its offerings. Chuan Hung or ‘Sichuan Alley’ focuses wholeheartedly on one particular Sichuan ingredient known as Mian Yang rice noodles. At Chuan Hung, these noodles are served the way they have always been for millennia: with a choice of different broths, and a variety of toppings such as braised beef and pig intestines.
Chuan Hung’s rice noodles are, admittedly, a little more distinctive: they are specially sourced from one particular artisan who lives in a village deep in Sichuan. Research for months into about 50 different Sichuan noodle shops led the Chuan Hung team to understand that only one particular shop sold the exact type and style of Mian Yang noodles that they wanted to present to Singaporeans – but it took close to a year and dozens of personal trips to the shop in sincere appeal before the owners finally softened and agreed to speak to them. It took even longer to research and try the different noodles the artisan made: every detail was examined, down to the gauge of the noodles in millimetres.The noodles now served in Chuan Hung are customised for the noodle house, and found nowhere else in Singapore or South East Asia. The noodles may be ordered with the clear or red soups as well as the uniquely Sichuan mix of red and clear. In addition, Chuan Hung also offers a third broth option: a deceptively clear soup that is piquantly infused with Sichuan vine pepper, and a dry-tossed version. Those with bigger appetites can feel free to order “add-ons” as extra toppings for the noodles, and a curated selection of small plates – archetypal Sichuan sides such as Fried Crispy Pig Intestines and Braised Eggplant – as accompaniment.
The interiors of Chuan Hung is deserving of attention from the diner as well. Located in a side alley just off the far busier main street in much the same way that noodle shops in China have been set up for years, Chuan Hung is a little haven of gently coloured wood, bamboo furnishings and warm lighting. The small space of half a dozen tables – bustling when full, and tranquil when quiet – is inspired by the aforementioned noodle shops though elevated with thoughtful design details to ensure comfort for the guest even at the busiest of times.

Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine,"Located on a quiet side street off Newton Circus flanked by towering apartment blocks is a very unlikely building. The structure is a sight to behold: through an ancient Chinese gateway with giant roaring lions guarding either side of its doors lies the Chui Huay Lim Club. Founded in 1845 as a place for prominent Teochew families to meet, you wouldn't guess the site's 166-year history from the brand new building that just opened in October.
The home of Singapore's oldest Teochew community club, you can be sure that dining at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine restaurant is one of the most authentic Teochew experiences possible. Run by the JUMBO Group of Restaurants, the food here has been refined to perfection by the keen eyes of generations of critical Teochew matriarchs. Classic dishes range from Cold Crab to Braised Duck, but for variety you'll also find some familiar favourites like Boiled Live Prawns and Chilli Crab. The seafood comes from tanks lining the restaurant, and was some of the best steamed pomfret the Chope Team has ever had. The house specialty though is clearly the Teochew Style Roasted Suckling Pig, which multi-generations seem to flock to the restaurant for day after day.
Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine offers traditional cuisine in a comfortable and tasteful setting - a must-try dining experience for your entire family, and you don't even need to be a member of the club!

Cibo Italiano,"Specialised marts are fast becoming the norm here - if you've never browsed through the quirky and unusual items in a Japanese grocery store, you're really missing out - and Cibo is undoubtedly one of the best we have.
If you're a nonna at heart, their extensive range of quality basics to more artisanal ingredients and drinks imported straight from Italy, will have you in raptures of joy. Neatly displayed in the modern store, the open wood and metal shelves stand out against the white exposed brick walls, and invite you to browse the aisles stocked with things you'd never find in our general supermarkets.
But as all good nonnas know, nothing beats actually trying the products. The good news is - you won't have to go far! Cibo cannily provides a menu of handmade dishes like Lasagna and Ravioli Porcini & Tartufo (homemade egg pasta stuffed with porcini and truffle in creamy sauce), appetisers like Tagliere di Addettati (a selection of cold cuts) and Puccia, their own special sourdough sandwich stuffed with Italian special varieties, as well as a long list of pizzas. If you're simply peckish, their fresh cheeses and wines make for a good snack as well.Perhaps this really is your first foray into specialised marts. In which case, Cibo's friendly staff, attractive mix of traditionally Italian items, modern grocer décor, and unpretentious Italian classics, will have you glad to say 'Ciao'.

City Hot Pot Shabu Shabu,"A view of the CBD. Quality meats. Interesting soup bases. City Hot Pot Shabu Shabu checks all of these boxes. Located on level 4 of One Raffles Place, this is the hot pot restaurant to go to after work when you’re craving for something comforting and soupy.

The soup bases here are extensive, from Herbal Chicken to Tomato and Korean Kimchi flavours. Most interesting is the fish soup with milk, a soup base not commonly found in many hotpot restaurants in town. Order this creamy rich broth and get plenty of seafood to swish in it, such as plump juicy scallops, fresh fish fillets and prawns, homemade prawn paste and clams.

If you’re a meat lover, City Hot Pot offers quality meats at great value. Tuck into beautifully marbled cuts like wagyu chuck eye roll and Angus short ribs, and savour the meats as the melt easily in your mouth.

Claypots Full Circle,"Years ago, two Singaporean university students in Melbourne walked into Claypots Full Circle, a charming family-owned eatery where they fell head over heels with the humble yet delicious fare. After on that fateful night, the two Singaporeans wooed the restaurant owner, convincing him to bring his exceptional seafood to Singapore.

Now located along the bustling Amoy Street, Claypots Full Circle astounds with its fresh seafood options done with a Mediterranean flair. Expect to see nothing but plates of whole fish, squid, mussels, oysters, and octopus so fresh it’s almost as if you caught it yourself. Kick off your meal with a platter of appetisers, from the Cantabrian Anchovies & Caramelised Onion Toast, to the trio of dips where tzatziki, hummus, and baba ganoush comes served with some warm flatbread.

Then it would be remiss to come to a restaurant without partaking in their specialty – food cooked in claypots. We love the Moroccan Claypot, which comes chock full of mussels, clams, fish, vegetables, and couscous. The Pan-seared Sea Bass Fillet is another heavenly delight, cooked to perfection so the fish is flaky and oh-so tender.

From a family-run restaurant in Melbourne to a welcoming eating joint on Amoy Street that the whole family will love, Claypots has come full circle and is now known for its tantalising  seafood dishes and lively vibes.

The Clifford Pier,"Glocal is a poor man’s portmanteau for the glamourous local gastronomy presented at The Clifford Pier at The Fullerton Bay Hotel. How else to describe the dizzyingly gorgeous lobby, fluttering with hushed, 5-star service? You’d never know this spot once harboured one of the city’s original bustling ports of call for maritime trade. Since 1933, ships would be warmly greeted with savoury local specialties dished out by floating hawkers. Honouring that charming bit of history, The Clifford Pier acts as a showstopping backdrop for all-day Southeast Asian nibbles.It’s hard to imagine the glittery shores of Marina Bay hosting anything other than the sleek luxuries it's known for, The Fullerton Bay Hotel being its crown jewel. As such, it’s a lovely thought that The Clifford Pier pays respects to the rich tradition of the Bay’s enterprising currents, showcasing the best that Old Singapore has to offer then and now. And The Clifford Pier isn’t paying tribute with just a local-tinted menu, but rather a fully educated selection including rich Laksa, Soup Kambing, The Pier's Lobster Roll, Heritage Bites and Wagyu Rendang.However the homey cuisine doesn’t collide with the frothy aesthetic of the cavernous dining room. As if plucked from the set of a Baz Luhrmann film, the lushly appointed space is swathed in nautical hues of mineral blues, sandy buffs and rich textures. Under ivory arches with a view of the bay, the familiar cuisine at The Clifford Pier is just the opulence you’d expect from The Fullerton Bay Hotel.

Already a popular favourite amongst in-the-know brunch crowds here, the Singapore outlet at quiet Purvis Street offers an understated variation of the bustling New York experience.
All the classics from its savoury-sweet Southern-style brunch menu are here in Singapore: crispy-skinned and tender Buttermilk Fried Chicken served on maple-kissed waffles, and fluffy hotcakes slicked with warm maple butter then paired with your choice of tangy blueberry compote, chocolate chunks, or banana walnut.
What's brunch without some eggy indulgence? Other New York staples include the ubiquitous Eggs Benedict, here served over a crumbly Southern buttermilk biscuit, and hearty Huevos Rancheros - fried eggs in a party of Mexican beans, guacamole, sour cream, and tomato salsa, all topped with a heap of Monterey Jack, then broiled to cheesy perfection. The unspoken crowning glory here is the brunch cocktails you can get round the clock for that real ""Sex and the City"" touch of weekend revelry; Mimosas, Bellinis and Whisky Sours paired with your carby breakfast keep Brunch O' Clock going before you sensibly sober up with a bracing black coffee and hit the town.

Cloudstreet,"Celebrated Chef Rishi Naleendra proudly unveils his highly-anticipated new undertaking, Cloudstreet, a showcase of thoughtful, expressive dishes and immaculate service distilled through an unrivalled culinary experience.

What started as a chance encounter between Chef Rishi and Gareth Burnett, Cloudstreet's General Manager, resulted in the genesis of a concept that reflects the duo's shared desire to create a dining room that exists on the philosophy of true hospitality. Joined by Sommelier Vinodhan Veloo, whose expertise has led him to devise the wine programs at Michelin-starred venues, they have forged the perfect team to see this vision to fruition.

Guests can expect a progressive yet sophisticated approach to gastronomy - marrying disparate cultures and influences in an exuberant expression, it champions ingredient-driven cuisine and seasonality. The food is enhanced by a wine list featuring around 350 natural and classic style wines which pay homage to some greats alongside small, independent winemakers from around the world. The restaurant has a strong focus on beverage pairings both alcoholic and temperance.

Club Meatballs by ClubCO,"Made from ground meat and enhanced with a medley of spices, the simple meatball can be found in nearly every cuisine around the world. And under the deft hands of chefs at Club Meatballs by ClubCO, a swanky eatery located in the Central Business District, the meatball is now elevated to new culinary heights with a menu that revolves around this humble dish.

In the day, you’ll find Club Meatballs by ClubCO serving the white-collar suits who flock here to tuck into the numerous healthy brekkie options such as the popular Homemade Natural Muesli, or sinking their teeth into one of the many delicious meatball subs during their busy lunch hour. We highly recommend The Vietnamese sub, which features chicken and cumin balls, red onions, carrots, and jalapenos that are stuffed between slices of freshly-baked Turkish bread. After dusk, this joint turns into a laidback hangout place where friends can gather to indulge in lively conversations over shared plates and drinks. Nothing goes better with meatballs than a soft burger bun, which is why we’re big fans of the Pimp Your Burger option where you can pick pick your meatballs, toppings, and sauce to your liking.

Conceived by the same brilliant culinary minds behind Sarnies and The Lokal, Club Meatballs by ClubCO is a testament to how the humble meatball can shine when executed perfectly.

The Coffee Academics (Raffles City),"If you work in the Central Business District  area, this is about to become your new favourite spot. Located in the basement of Raffles City, this incarnation of the luxe Hong Kong coffee franchise features a Nitro-stop concept to cater to the go-getters of the city.

This coffee franchise took Hong Kong by storm in 2012, and arrived on Singapore shores in 2016. Since then, it has become the go-to place for coffee aficionados to get a good brew. And for good reason, too. The coffee made here comes from the top 5% of Arabica beans, and their blend is ranked third worldwide.

The amazing cold brew is featured in their Nitro Coffee which is a pressurised cold brew that is smooth on the tongue and deliciously refreshing - the perfect pick me up for busy mornings. Looking for something moreish? Try the Academics Breakfast - it includes every component of a classic American breakfast, but better. Think Prosciutto Di Parma Ham, Bockwurst Pork Sausages, and scrambled eggs so creamy they melt in your mouth.

One of the best dishes on the menu, and exclusive to the Raffles Place outlet, is The Mess. Featuring a perfectly cooked egg buried in a mound of potatoes and sausages, this dish is best enjoyed with a glass of cold brew, and thankfully, that’s what this spot does best.

The coffee made here comes from the top 5% of Arabica beans, and their blend is ranked third worldwide.

The smell of freshly roasted coffee hits you as soon as you step into this swish spot, but that’s not the only reason you should come here - their menu is just as enticing as their beverages. Try the Academics Breakfast - it includes every component of a classic American breakfast, but better.

For something more wholesome, try the Chilli Crab Pizza - a spicy sweet rendition of the national classic.

Coffee enthusiasts will love seven stations at the Pedder on Scotts outlet.

COLLIN’S® (Changi Airport),"With a local presence of over 18 restaurants islandwide, this spot is a testament to homegrown talent Collin Ho’s  passion for providing delicious fare at affordable prices. The restaurants have amassed numerous accolades over the years, most notably the Singapore Prestige Brand Award for Most Popular Promising Brand.

The dishes here are both Instagram-worthy and delicious. The Charcoal Grilled Octopus Leg is a unique looking dish served on a wooden board with Potato Gratin and Romesco Sauce. Items on the Epicurean menu are a little moreish, and consist of a meat main, salad, and fries. These dishes are all under $20, which means that you can have a sumptuous meal without breaking the bank. Some of our favourite dishes include the Collins’ All-Day Brunch, which is a plate filled with brunch staples like bratwurst and sunny-side up. The Dry Aged Beef Burger is another crowd favourite. The patty is made of dry-aged beef and topped with honey baked ham, cheddar, and egg.

Diners who are after something healthier and lighter will love the Grilled Chicken Salad. Generous chunks of grilled chicken breast are tossed with mesclun salad, tomatoes, and refreshing Japanese cucumber. The Grilled Jumbo Asparagus is excellent, and dipped in the Romesco sauce the dish is served with, it’s almost heavenly.

Colony,"At first glance, Colony looks like yet another hotel buffet restaurant, but a clever hand with the interior blends the nostalgia of a bygone British-colonial era with more modern trappings. Partitions, vintage furnishings, and a smattering of tartan and houndstooth prints provide the charm, but it’s the impressive gastronomic journey that will keep you coming back for more.
The seven kitchens and accompanying 'live cooking stations' highlight the best of local cuisines and include Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Malaysian, and Western dishes. You'll be inundated with choice - fresh seafood, perfectly grilled meats, laksa and other signature Singaporean dishes, dim sum, breads baked the traditional Tandoor way, and a wide variety of pastries and desserts. Wash it all down with refreshing juices or seek out Colony's resident mixologist to whip up specialty cocktails like the ""Bengal Brew"" or the ""Governor's Invitation"".

Columbus Coffee Co.,"From the folks that brought you Lunar Coffee Brewers and Atlas Coffeehouse, comes this classy addition to the Upper Thomson cafe strip. Named after the great explorer Christopher Columbus, this sizeable spot serves up dishes inspired by a range of cuisines - this is not your usual cafe fare.

The Soft-Shell Crab Burger is a crowd favourite, and for good reason. Fluffy brioche buns encase a crisp deep-fried soft shell crab patty topped with delicious furikake eggs and caramelised onions. The curly fries on the side go perfectly with the rich burger. Another popular, albeit lighter, option is the Salmon Soba Noodles. Made with poached salmon, bouncy soba noodles, and topped with cilantro-lime nori yogurt, this dish is tangy, gentle on the palate, and won’t undo any diet plans you may have. For something a little sweeter, opt for the Candied Bacon Buttermilk Waffle, a soft waffle served with bacon that has been tossed in sugar - the unique sweet and salty flavour combined with the tenderness of the waffle makes for a delicious and memorable dish.

Cafe junkies after their caffeine fix will be glad to know that Columbus offers specialty coffee from local roasters Two Degrees North. From a smooth latte to a sophisticated v60 filter brew,  the rigorous standards and consistency held by the team is the foundation of their success.

COMO Cuisine,"Clean, contemporary, and healthful. That’s the philosophy underpinning the cooking at COMO Cuisine, a dining establishment that formerly existed as a pop-up but has now found a permanent home on the chic grounds of COMO Dempsey.

By drawing inspiration from the region’s rich culinary heritage, the restaurant surprises and astounds with its clever use of Asian ingredients and techniques. Perennial favourites include the heaping Our Big Raw Salad, which features a guilt-free indulgence of fresh and raw fruits and vegetables. There are a number of featured dishes inspired by the Indian subcontinent, such as the crunchy Samosas stuffed with spiced lamb and topped with a sweet and tangy mango chutney. Or opt for the Lamb Kofta, which has a hint of smokiness from the tandoor that’s fired by coconut charcoal. To make dining a family-friendly affair, the restaurant shies away from predictable kids’ menus. Instead, COMO Cuisine encourages young diners to expand their palates by choosing any dish that is served in a smaller portion.

Designed by Italian architect and designer, Paola Navone, COMO Cuisine’s decor is a stunning interplay of light and elegant elements to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.

Copper Chimney,"Amongst the hustle and bustle at the heart of Little India’s Syed Alwi Road, a Chindian restaurant is spicing up the vibrant Indian food scene with a new chef and a new menu.
Copper Chimney, the 10-year-old Syed Alwi flagship which prides itself in its distinctive North Indian and Chinese Indian cuisine, has gotten a fresh new interior on Level 2 with cosy private dining rooms and a revamped menu since CEO Adnan Bamboat took over in 2014.

Diners can choose from a wide variety of vegetarian and meat dishes on the new menu.  For vegetarians who want to try something different from the popular paneer variations, they can tuck into the Methi Malai Mutter, a creamy Punjabi dish of peas cooked in fenugreek leaves and spices. The Veg Jaipuri, a Rajasthan dish featured in Copper Chimney’s newly revamped menu, consists of a colourful medley of spring vegetables, simmered delicately in piquant cream, and served on a bed of peppered papad shards.
Seafood and meat lovers can tuck into Copper Chimney’s Fish Tikka Masala, one of the most popular Indian dishes in the United Kingdom, and the Mutton Roganjosh, a delightful Kashmiri dish that’s brimming with flavours of fennel, ginger and marked by a striking red hue.

Don’t forget to tuck into the Cranky Cats waffles, which have become something of a star in the recent years for its crisp on the outside yet fluffy on the inside goodness; top the delicious treat with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream and a slight drizzle of salted caramel sauce and you get a decadent treat none can resist. Cranky Cats also spins a refreshing twist to this classic waffle-and-ice cream combo with the aptly named Whoa-ffles, where a scoop of fragrant pandan ice cream and gooey gula melaka sauce replaces the vanilla ice cream and salted caramel sauce.

Other magical must-tries include the Guinness tiramisu, To Arthur with Love, a cheeky nod to the creator of Guinness beers, as well as the Kick Lai Liao, a chocolate and peanut butter cheesecake that is every dessert connoisseur’s dream.

Cumi Bali,"At Cumi Bali, the food speaks for itself and its long history is proof. Having opened its coors more than 20 years, this Indonesian behemoth dazzles with its unpretentious Indonesian fare. The interior is stripped back, with simple Indonesian artefacts dotting the walls while an adorable dancing fish mascot stands at the door ready to greet diners.

What makes Indonesian fare so unique is its heady spice blends or “bumbu” where an amalgamation of the different spices create gorgeous flavour profiles that linger with every bite. Some noteworthy dishes that epitomise this mouthwatering phenomenon include the Ikan Bakar, where the fish, smothered in 18 different spices and top-grilled to perfection, emerges exceptionally tender with a thick spice paste reminiscent of otak-otak atop, packing all the flavours and juices in. And with the restaurant named after their signature dish, you bet that the Cumi Bali - a springy char-grilled squid dish - has that melt-in-the-mouth factor that we just can’t get enough of. Be sure to order Sate Madura as well, an 8-inch-long chicken satay grilled with kecap manis and topped with fried shallots that has become a much-loved favourite.

Finally, have you really had Indonesian if you didn’t savour some stunning rendang? Cumi Bali hits the nail on the head with their Kambing Rendang and its sister dish, the Sapi Rendang, both of which are perennial favourites. End with a lovely Cendol for a sweet end to a delicious and satisfying meal that has kept diners coming back for over two decades.

CURATE,"If you’re a diner who enjoys trying the food of visiting chefs from out of town, then book your table at CURATE. This RWS stalwart is helmed by resident chef Benjamin Halat, who is joined every three months by international guest chefs from Michelin-starred restaurants overseas who create fine degustation menus together with him.

Chef Halat’s pedigreed background means he can hold his own, too. When not joined by visiting chefs, the German native consistently turns out bold, cutting-edge European dishes. Appetisers begin on a fun note, with a picnic basket of homemade German pretzels and obatzda, camembert cheese infused with cumin and paprika. These lead the way to equally creative mains, like a smoked fish tartare with pickled daikon that is the chef’s interpretation of a popular charcoal-grilled fish you’ll find in the beer gardens of Bavaria in springtime. The star of the show, though, Russishes Ei. Chef Halat, turns an organic farm egg into a light and fluffy souffle texture, placing it atop a bed of potato cream and champagne foam on the side, with a dollop of Beluga caviar. It’s a luxurious dish that is light as air yet tasty at the same time, and is what keeps you coming back to CURATE even when there isn’t a visiting chef in town.

DC Super Heroes Cafe (Takashimaya),"Okay, so after a while, you realise the food here is sumptuous Western grill fare given cheeky superhero themed names, but so what? This is one of the most enjoyable places in town, with its wall-to-wall comic book trappings, superhero insignias and paraphernalia littered every from the table to the menu to the toilet, and that indescribable energy of being surrounded by other comic book lovers. It’s the magic of DC, and now you can eat it. Suspend your disbelief and tuck into a sizzling plate of Commissioner Gordon Crime Scene Tenderloin, not a bunch of degenerate villains, but meaty grilled angus Tenderloin served with baked potatoes, garden vegetables, and beef gravy. There’s also the Smallville Special Roasted Chicken, a whole chook that arrives on the table with its tender breast proudly puffed out, bearing the logo of none other than Superman.

A tremendous amount of effort goes into the burger menu, offering some of the most colourful and superheroic items at this joint. Our favourite is Green Lantern Hal’s Homemade Mushroom Tofu Burger that, beyond just being a healthy burger, is branded with the Green Lantern’s insignia (green for vegetarian, geddit?). The cheeky superhero nods aside, the food is legitimately tasty, and this stacks up as a grill restaurant worth its weight in kryptonite. Kids will love the extra colourful desserts, where the kitchen goes wild with comic-book coloured icicle pops bearing the logos of all sorts of superheroes, from the Flash to Wonder Woman, bearing flavours like Thai Milk Tea and French Vanilla. Come for the comic book kitsch but definitely stay for the yummy food. That’s the superhero way.

Decker Barbecue,"Meat-lovers would be proud to call Decker Barbecue their second home. This casual, no-frills establishment located along charming Robertson Quay serves up authentic Texan-style barbecued meats that have gone through the time-honoured tradition of low and slow smoking within Decker’s custom-built smoker for 16 hours.

A collaboration between Club Street Social and Bali’s famed Smokehouse BBQ, Decker also prides itself on quality meats at reasonable prices. Meats here are sliced to order and sold by weight, so you can have as much or as little as you like of that fall-off-the-bone goodness. Look forward to a meaty affair with Decker’s delicious Brisket, Spare Ribs, Buffalo Wings, and Chopped Beef. There is no bad choice here - the perfectly smoked meats are tender, juicy, and bursting with flavour. On weekends, treat yourself with the Pork Belly Burnt Ends and the aptly-named Dinosaur Rib, a succulent 600-gram bone-in beef short rib. The sandwich combos are also worthy of mention, and our favourite has got to be the “Big Daddy” Fried Chicken, where a chunky piece of crispy fried chicken is piled high with slaw, jalapenos, and barbecue sauce and slapped between two plump buns.

Amp up your meat order with classic all-American side dishes made in-house daily such as the Brisket Beans (barbecue baked beans and smoked brisket), mouthwatering Cornbread, and of course,  Mac ‘N Cheese. End off with the Banana Pudding with an authentic southern dessert that we just can’t get enough off.

Timber furniture, carved wooden screens, red cloth aplenty, you half expect an epic fight to break out in Dian Xiao Er, with kungfu kicks and wine barrels flying around.

Except the only fight one can imagine here is over the famous Herbal Roasted Duck that has been the mainstay of the Dian Xiao Er menu for the last 12 years. The dark herbal gravy that the duck comes bathed in is made of 10 Chinese herbs that include codonopsis root, foxglove root, and licorice root. This gravy is said to have a calming effect while relieving mental stress and revitalizing energy. We were definitely very energized after eating this duck, not least because of its succulence and moistness. The duck skin itself is also crispy and adds a satisfying crunch to the dish. Paired with fragrant steamed rice, the flavours of this dish are strong, but not overpowering.

Try the other dishes on the menu as well; Dian Xiao Er specializes in traditional Chinese comfort food such as melt-in-the-mouth Dong Po Pork and refreshing Silver Cod Fish in Superior Soy Sauce.

Ding Dong,"Located at Singapore’s trendy Amoy Street, Ding Dong brings a contemporary twist to Southeast Asian cuisine, and it all starts with the space. You think you know what to expect with Southeast Asian food, and as you approach Ding Dong’s heritage shophouse address in an old Singapore neighbourhood, nothing seems out of the ordinary. Then you walk in and are greeted by a heady pastiche of vintage posters from all around the region, set against bold geometric prints, pop-art colours, and an upbeat soundtrack. It’s Andy Warhol meets a busy Bangkok street, a vibe that pretty much announces Ding Dong’s intentions: take a little bit of nostalgia and heritage and give it a magical Willy Wonka makeover.

The food here takes Southeast Asian flavours, textures, and ingredients out of their rustic home-cooked origins and puts them on an elegant, upmarket plate. Some of the results seem downright unlikely – Stuffed you tiao with otah mousse & kafir lime mayonnaise, or a cut of Iberico pork collar char siew treatment and served with an unusual caramelized pineapple with pork crackling, but they make for a deeply satisfying marriage of flavours and textures. More familiar take on regional food include the Chendol mai, attap seeds with gula melaka ice-cream. Come re-discover the Southeast Asian flavours you know so well in a brand new shape and form, and grab a cocktail from the superb bar while you're at it.

Don & Tori,"Meat on rice is such a deceptively simple concept, but does anything else truly cut to the heart of Asian cuisine? Here at Don & Tori, Donburi, the classic Japanese take on meat and rice is the big highlight, and it’s served up in the kinds of digs you’d expect at a Tras street location: oozing cool and modern hip, with subtle traditional touches in the decor. Before the donburi, get a few of the signature maki, bursting with textural contrasts. Like the Crispy Salmon Skin Maki, featuring shatteringly crisp skin, crunchy pickles, and fragrant shisho leaf tucked between mouthfuls of tender rice. Also good is the Truffle Negima & Ebi Tempura Maki that combines all of our favourite things into a single hand-held treat: meaty amberjack, crunchy shrimp tempura, crunchy cucumbers, and fragrant truffle oil.

The main event is a series of Instagram-worthy and stomach-filling donburi. All the classics are here. Think Singapore’s favourite genre of donburi, the Chirashi Don, thick-cut sashimi slices lightly dressed in a wasabi soy sauce. A more luxe version of that comes in the form of the Hokkaido Don, which as the name promises comes topped with Hokkaido sea treasures like scallops, salmon roe, and chopped fatty tuna. For the queen of donburi, get the blissfully simple but mouth-watering Uni Don, featuring two kinds of Hokkaido sea urchin, red and sea-water, each one turning this bowl of rice into a transcendent experience. Away from seafood, there are meaty offerings like the Truffle Wagyu Foie Gras Don featuring Seared Joshu wagyu, foie gras and onsen egg with garlic chips and truffle oil for a hefty blast of luxury. Wind down with a little bowl of tart Yuzu Sorbet to calm down your palate and ease off that food coma, and plan your next trip back to guzzle down more of these delicious rice bowls!

Don Quijote,"Recently relocated to Dempsey, Don Quijote has been satisfying Spanish food lovers in Singapore for years with its authentic and delicious cuisine. Feast with friends over an abundant selection of tapas and other Spanish specialities, like Paella (saffron-seasoned rice and seafood slow-cooked in a large pan) and Fiedeuas (the noodle version of paella). The drinks menu also offers plenty of Spanish flair with three kinds of sangria and a one-country wine list, offering the most extensive variety of Spanish wines in Singapore.
The ambience of the restaurant’s new Dempsey location takes Don Quijote’s dining experience to the next level. The spacious interior is so large that it houses two private dining rooms while the Spanish-inspired décor keeps the restaurant feeling cosy with warm touches like exposed brick, red accent walls, and clay-coloured tiles.

Dookki Singapore (Clementi),"Dookki, which means '2 meals' in Korean, is a fun and delicious dining concept in Clementi Mall. The 'first meal' begins with the much-loved Korean dish “Topokki” cooked to one's preferred level of spiciness.  Diners can then continue to their 'second meal', the Kimchi fried rice, by adding rice, kimchi, sweet corn to the remaining Topokki sauce!

To ensure that customers get to enjoy the most authentic taste from Korea, Dookki Singapore offers 6 types of Topokki, all air-flown from Korea. Other Korean dishes include ‘Eomuk’ (Korean Fishcake), Kimnari (Korean Seaweed Roll) and QQ noodles. There are 6 types of sauces varying in different degrees of spiciness, including a non-spicy sweet sauce for those who don't enjoy spicy food. There is also a variety of fish cake air-flown from Korea, spicy and non-spicy chicken dishes, seafood, tempura, vegetables and a wide selection of Ramyeon for diners to indulge in. For cheese lovers, a Double Cheese Ring can be added to the order for that ultimate satisfaction. Finally, a meal has to be completed with dessert, and Dookki diners enjoy Free flow Bingsu!

The Dragon Chamber,"When you arrive looking for The Dragon Chamber, you will find yourself at the entrance of a Kopitiam where patrons are sipping beer and having a bowl of noodles—just an ordinary street food stall. “This must be the place,” you say to yourself. The hostess then gestures you toward the beer fridge as if to offer you a drink. But instead of pulling out a tasty cold brew, the fridge door opens up into a portal into another realm like something out of a real-life Alice in Wonderland. “This is where you must continue alone,” says the hostess, as the fridge door opens into a street alley that transports you into the braised underbelly of the “Long Tang” that is The Dragon Chamber. Things are not always as they appear.
Secretly located within a brightly coloured Kopitiam, The Dragon Chamber is a speakeasy-style restaurant and bar. What may look like a regular beer fridge in a kopitiam is actually a secret door that opens up into its own inner recesses. Reminiscent of Chinatown gambling dens and secret society hangouts, the walls of The Dragon Chamber are covered with artwork from local and regional artists such as Sabotage, Mister Tucks, and Riandy Karuniawan, referencing past and recent Chinese tradition from a globalist, counter-culture point of view.
The Dragon Chamber offers an unconventional menu serving “guerilla style” food, representing dishes that are not typical banquet style Chinese food. Among its own wild concoctions from The Dragon Chamber’s test kitchen, the underground restaurant also brings back age-old Chinese dishes that never caught on in mainstream restaurants, because of unconventional ingredients. Yet the flavours are immense. Contrasting lovable Chinese-American recipes, The Dragon Chamber pushes the diner’s comfort zone with adventurous dishes that may even shock diners with unusual Chinese techniques of nose-to-tail animal preparation. One such dish is the Dragon’s Claw. Touted as one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, it features a Crocodile Foot braised in Chinese herbs, served on a bed of greens and a literal ring of fire. Bearing a taste similarly close to chicken, the meat is tender and sweet. Its skin is painstakingly descaled with a torch, revealing a thick and rich layer of collagen that coats the succulent herb-marinated meat with a soft and sticky texture, adding a consistent mouthfeel to every bite. If crocodile foot and mammal innards might be too adventurous for some, we also offer more conventional favourites such as Firecracker Chicken and Wagyu Truffle Hor Fun.
Not a space for political correctness and mellow elevator music, the restaurant recommends not bringing any overtly conservative in-laws you might have. Make your way down to The Dragon Chamber, we dare you to enter the bowels of Chinese cuisine to discover your true gastronomic self.

Drinks & Co Grill,"The original Club Street bottle-shop concept has been a long-standing favourite amongst discerning night owls in Singapore, and here the people behind Drinks & Co have expanded down the street into a larger space. Also expanded is their food menu, with an extensive grill section. This is definitely a more dressed up version of the brand, perfect for dates and big groups, especially since the heaving portions here demand to be shared. Off the grill comes the Co Wagyu Burger, enrobed in melty cheese and served with freshly-baked buns for mouthfuls of perfection. Then there’s the Char Grilled Beef Skirt Steak, still smoking at the edges as it arrives served up with a zingy chimichurri sauce and fluffy fried potatoes.

If you’re looking for a more restrained booze and bites situation, the elegant tapas menu here is the right fit. Think delicate little Shrimp Beignets with a twee and old fashioned cocktail sauce, or Burrata Cheese & San Daniele Ham for a little hit of creamy, salty, gooey goodness to go with some bubbly. Then there’s the Fried Brava Potatoes with Chili Mayo & Ricotta Cheese for a carb bomb that’s actually worth it.

Drinks & Co Kitchen,"Drinks & Co, stalwarts of the Club Street scene, have powered into the original nightlife enclave: Holland Village. Riding on their celebrated bottle-shop plus bistro concept, the group has devised a more French brasserie approach for this Village outpost, with a menu devised by chef Adama Koita. Open with a classic Cold Cut Charcuterie Board, a playground of your favourite cured meats including pork rillettes, chorizo, and salami, served up with crunchy cornichons and artisanal bread. There’s also an Artisanal Cheese Platter to go with the bright, robust wines on offer from the shelves.

Mains here come in the form of smoky grilled meats. Think hearty steaks like the Grilled Ribeye served with a medley of seasonal vegetables and red wine jus, or the New Zealand Rack of Lamb served up with French ratatouille and a salad of puffed rice. Other mains take a more British gastropub turn, with a Classic Fish & Chips, featuring beer battered Sea Bass, and Bangers & Mash made with fatty Kurobuta Pork Toulouse Sausages, crowning the menu. Dessert is a classic Chocolate Lava Cake affair, though you should also get the Raspberry Dome, an elegant, tangy confection, and make a double-dessert night of it. After all, this place is all about sharing, and with vibes this good, you’ll definitely want to bring a friend or two along for the ride.

The Drunken Poet,"There aren’t a lot of Irish restaurants and bars in Singapore, but this spot looks to be bringing the often overlooked cuisine to the forefront of the local dining scene with their traditional dishes, inviting atmosphere, and affordable prices.

You can’t go wrong with the Irish Potato & Bacon Cakes. Made with freshly grated potatoes and bacon deep fried to perfection, this dish is the perfect bar snack to enjoy with a Guiness. For something a  little moreish, opt for the Guinness Pie, a delicious pastry dish that is made with beef brisket, celery, carrots, and potatoes. This meaty classic is made with all the elements of Irish cuisine - beer, potatoes, and carrots. Adventurous diners can try the Spicy Red Bull Wings - fiery chicken wings marinated in a chilli sauce with a hint of red bull.

Bar grub wouldn’t be complete without a meaty main, and the hot favourite at this bar is the Chef’s Pork Ribs. The generous portion of ribs are coated in a secret marinade that is tangy, spicy and coats the ribs entirely. The other signature dish, the Poet’s Burger, consists of a juicy homemade beef patty drizzled in a rich secret sauce, then topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and onions and sandwiched between two fluffy buns.

The charming nautical-themed decor and handsome wooden touches throw you straight into a seafaring fantasy right in the middle of King Albert Park. It’s the perfect mid-shopping getaway for those tired feet and hunger pangs: expect comforting nosh and hearty cafe grub, alongside an invigorating cup of strong coffee. Except this isn’t your usual cafe fare. There’s a healthy amount of kitchen wizardry at work here. Think of hefty appetizers like their signature Treasures in a Bun, a pillowy steamed bun stuffed with slow-braised pork belly done up with caramelized ginger chili sauce and crunchy fried shallots. This is matched with fiery Thai-influenced salads like the Pomelo Pick Me Up, a salad of tender poached prawns tossed in a zingy sweet chili lime dressing, dressed with peanuts, and scattered with tart pomelo gems for a true party in the mouth.

For something even heftier, and more indulgent, get the Foie Gras Wagyu Burger, which hits all the luxury eating sweet spots: meltingly fatty foie gras crowns a juicy Wagyu patty that’s sandwiched between fluffy brioche buns and held together by a lovely onion marmalade and mushrooms.

A popular favourite is the Smoked Spring Chicken, where a deboned slab of cherry wood-smoked chicken sits is served with their signature ramen. Craving soup? The Tortellini with Ramen is where handmade pasta shells are stuffed with minced meat and whole prawns, dipped in a hot chicken broth scented with hints of osmanthus. Wash your bowl of noodles down with an ice cold beer.

Eight Treasures Vegetarian Restaurant,"This vegetarian restaurant has been around since 2007, and if that isn’t a testament to its food, we don’t know what is. Located just steps from the iconic Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, this eatery has a menu that could easily convert any carnivore. The restaurant’s motto, meatless does not mean tasteless, is echoed in many of the menu items, which are made with plant-based meat alternatives that are just as good, if not better than the original.

The Marmite Vegetarian Pork Ribs are a chef specialty, and made with soy and yeast extract. While it may not sound very appealing, the combination of rich soy meat and earthy Marmite makes for a delectable combination - perfect as a snack or as an accompaniment to some freshly steamed jasmine rice.

Another dish worth trying is the Vegetarian Peking Duck. The clever use of fresh yam fried to crisp perfection to make the “duck meat” and the delicious taste of the of the dish itself are enough to convince you that you’re chowing down on real meat. Hankering for some treasures of the sea? Fret not, as they’ve got that on the menu as well. Try the Thai Sauce Cod Fish - a spicy sour dish of mock fish meat doused in a Thai-inspired dressing.

Elbow Room by Drinks & Co,"This reliable Club Street boozer has long pleased the Chinatown night crowd with its casual, no-frills menu and by-the-bottle drinks selection. Essentially a bottle-shop with a series of tables along heaving shelves of wines and spirits, this is a chic and popular place to grab a tipple and some bar bites along this bustling nightlife stretch. With a jovial crowd made up of regulars, it’s also a destination unto itself, not just a trusty pre-game! While you decide what bottle to pluck off the shelves, nibble on some sharing plates and tapas. Sharing portions of succulent Marinated New Zealand Lamb Chops, Mini Wagyu Burgers, and tender Marinated Australian Beef Tenderloin Slices will tick off the meat quotient for the table, while a zingy Fresh Tuna Tartare with Avocado & Ponzu is a lighter, more white-wine appropriate plate.

For some mean shared platters, choose from the kitchen’s list of pizzas, made to order, and featuring various fun ingredients over an artisanal aged pizza dough that will have you eating each slice to the very end. Popular flavours include the Samurai, featuring teriyaki chicken chunks, onion, and green chili for a devilishly spicy Asian-style pizza. Also good is the classic Italian Capricciosa, a medley of Mozzarella, mushrooms, pork sausage, black olives, and artichokes over a tangy tomato base. The grill menu here is unexpectedly big for such an unassuming space, churning out hearty burgers and grilled joints, including a particularly indulgent Roast Rack of New Zealand Lamb, a heaving monster of tender, smoky lamb served with a delicate ratatouille and loads of rich jus. Or, for something a little less fancy but just as satisfying, chow down on the Mexico Burger, a Wagyu patty that’s spruced up with fiery jalapenos, salsa, and melted cheese. Food may not be in the name of this bar and grill, but it’s certainly no afterthought!

Element on Tras Street,"Tucked comfortably in Amara Singapore, this hotel restaurant-bar dishes out comfort food in an elegant setting. Warm lighting and round wooden tables lend a sense of cosiness to the space, in line with the food served here.
Sink your teeth into the Crispy Chicken Burger, a tasty combination of juicy thigh meat, crisp lettuce and sweet tomatoes. Pepperoni fans will also fall in love with the Chorizo Pizza here. The thin, leopard-spotted crust provides a good crunch, but what elevates the usual pepperoni pizza combo is the addition of diced spiced sausage which adds a slight hint of heat.
Meat lovers, the Steak Frites is meant to satisfy all cravings. Imagine a generous slab of Black Angus ribeye, seared in its savoury jus, with crispy golden fries and a side salad. Save room for the creative desserts — the usually-pungent jackfruit is toned down with cream and fresh berries in a Cempedak Creme Brulee, the perfect way to enjoy this delicious but misunderstood fruit.

Ellenborough Market Cafe,"Think Peranakan cuisine, but bigger, bolder, and better. Step into a sanctuary where kings and queens feast. The space features pristine dining halls comprising three dining zones in a heritage-meets-contemporary style. The main dining hall is dressed in vibrant turquoise and accented with a sparkling diamond-cut glass wall feature, the lilac mezzanine is drenched in light through the restored stained-glass skylight, while in the classy dining room, the show kitchen's buffet lines take centrestage.
The cafe offers a flirty buffet repertoire boasting a tantalising medley of Asian and international delights, with a spotlight on authentic Peranakan cuisine. Think evergreen favourites like Ayam Buah Keluak and Babi Pongteh, but with a splash of excitement through the restaurant's modern take on these classics. While you feast on these mouthwatering delights, remember to save some space for daily specials such as the Roast Beef and Leg of Lamb served up at the Carving Station. Other must-trys include the decadent Pork Belly La Mian, the Durian Fritters, where succulent durian flesh oozes out of the crispy exterior, and the Traditional Muah Chee that's prepared a la minute.

EMPRESS,"The Privé Group's first foray into Chinese cuisine, EMPRESS snags a prime spot in the Asian Civilisations Museum. Offering up waterfront dining, the restaurant boasts an excellent view of the Singapore River. A theme of mixing old and new flows throughout the restaurant and nicely echoes the design philosophy of the museum. It's contemporary interior and vibrant décor contrasts with the colonial facade, and diners will surely enjoy the juxtaposition of casual dining whilst nestled in the confines of a formal museum.
This trend continues with the menu. EMPRESS features dishes that are a mainstay of Cantonese cuisine but does so in a way that blends good ole' Cantonese flavours with more modern touches. Don't worry, you'll still be able to recognize items from dim sum to their signature roast meats. Speaking of which, the Triple Roast Platter, which showcases Spare Ribs, Char Siew, and Roast Pork, all of which are carefully cooked to retain that perfect level of juiciness, is a team favourite! EMPRESS also bucks convention with their Western-style salads and plated desserts including the decadent Sticky Date & Longan Pudding. On weekends and public holidays, EMPRESS also offers a sumptuous dim sum buffet which you can pair with champagne for an indulgent treat.
All in all, EMPRESS hopes to eradicate the notion that Cantonese cuisine can be a bit stuffy, and you'll no doubt agree once you experience the relaxed environment and accessible dishes.

Esquina,"If you're a tapas lover, you've probably already met, fallen for, and likely tried to marry Esquina, a charming hole-in-the-wall restaurant wrapped around a corner of Jiak Chuan in Keong Saik. With nostalgic Spanish kitchen curios and rough-hewn textures, the final product is a modern depiction of an urban canteen in Seville.
Esquina has seen two chef changes since its founding, but the tradition of strong flavours and Spanish flair continues on with Executive Chef Carlos Montobbio. Born in Barcelona, the 28 year old has over ten years of experience despite his youth, including time spent in Michelin-starred restaurants, which accounts for the sophistication of the food and plating.
While the second storey offers a quieter and equally quaint setting, you might prefer to sit around the frenetic open kitchen on the ground floor to marvel at the works of art being created not two feet away. Perfectly tender Grilled Spanish Octopus, the deceptively plain-sounding Spanish Omelette, and more unique Wagyu Beef Intercostals are just a few of the delicious plates you can find on the six-sectioned menu.

Esquina,"If you're a tapas lover, you've probably already met, fallen for, and likely tried to marry Esquina, a charming hole-in-the-wall restaurant wrapped around a corner of Jiak Chuan in Keong Saik. With nostalgic Spanish kitchen curios and rough-hewn textures, the final product is a modern depiction of an urban canteen in Seville.
Esquina has seen two chef changes since its founding, but the tradition of strong flavours and Spanish flair continues on with Executive Chef Carlos Montobbio. Born in Barcelona, the 28 year old has over ten years of experience despite his youth, including time spent in Michelin-starred restaurants, which accounts for the sophistication of the food and plating.
While the second storey offers a quieter and equally quaint setting, you might prefer to sit around the frenetic open kitchen on the ground floor to marvel at the works of art being created not two feet away. Perfectly tender Grilled Spanish Octopus, the deceptively plain-sounding Spanish Omelette, and more unique Wagyu Beef Intercostals are just a few of the delicious plates you can find on the six-sectioned menu. The tiny digs may leave you without a seat if you haven't made a reservation, but Esquina is definitely worth the wait.

Dining here is almost like dining in a good friend’s living room — the intimate 40-seater is warmly lit, and has a homely vibe to it.  For appetisers, the Parmigiania de Melanzane is a good way to whet the appetite, with its baked eggplants layered with mozzarella cheese and fresh basil. The meaty aubergines are soft, bathed in a sweet tomato sauce perfect for dipping into with some focaccia bread.

Pastas here are simple yet delicious. A popular dish is the lobster ravioli, with butter pistachio cream and prawns, as well as the carbonara, which comes with a dollop of caviar and mullet roe, generously sprinkled with a crack of fresh black pepper. Etna’s specialty is the housemade pizzas, with a crispy base that supports fresh ingredients like mushrooms, artichokes and mixed seafood.

Everest Kitchen,"This quaint restaurant is a veteran of the North Indian dining scene in Singapore, and has been serving up classics like Butter Chicken and Palak Paneer to hungry crowds for over a decade. Also on the menu are beloved Nepalese classics like Momo dumplings, as well as some unique creations like the Mustang Coffee.

Looking to indulge in North Indian classics? Dive straight in to the Rogan Josh - a spicy curry native to Kashmir. The mutton chunks are stewed in ginger, garlic, and tomatoes, giving it a rich and sharp flavour which pairs perfectly with a Naan fresh from the Tandoor. The Mutton Vindaloo is perfect for spice lovers looking to test their threshold. Prefer something a little less searing? Opt for the Egg Bhurji - scrambled eggs, Indian style.

Diners with a more adventurous palate can try the Sukuti. This dish consists of mutton marinated in traditional Himalayan spices and cooked to tender perfection. The meat is crisp and the spices give it a kick that will have you reaching for a drink. Douse the fire in your mouth with the Mustang Coffee - a beloved Nepalese beverage made with coffee and a generous helping of alcohol - think Bailey’s, but rustic.

Extra Virgin Pizza (Asia Square),"When we think of pizza, we think of a solid, golden, crispy crust, fresh, just-off-the-vine tomatoes blended to make a savoury sauce, and endless amounts of cheese, and that’s exactly what Extra Virgin Pizza in Asia Square delivers.

With flour shipped straight from Italy, and tomatoes imported from “the golden state”, it’s no wonder why with every bite we feel so entranced by the authentic and harmonious flavours.

The creations by Extra Virgin Pizza are famous for evoking all of your taste buds and with starters like Hot Wings and Cauliflower Romesco, it only makes sense that you come prepared to indulge. The Oven-Fired Clams, another popular starter on the menu, are drizzled with white wine sauce and encased with garlic, making for the perfect introduction to the meal.

As for their glorious pizzas? You probably should gather all your friends so you can try all the amazing concoctions. From the Pepper Pig Pizza, a crowd-favourite for meat-lovers, to the Pistachio & Pumpkin, a pistachio pesto-based pizza topped with pumpkin, baby arugula, lemon vinaigrette and three cheeses - the endless unique options make this pizzeria stand out from the rest.

Pair any of the pizzas with their housemade sodas, beers (on tap or bottled), a cuppa of specialty coffee roasted by Papa Palheta or a glass of wine.

It's a vision of paradise, and Fat Cow delivers on that promise.
One of the most beloved restaurants in town, specialising in premium Wagyu served in delicate modern Japanese plates, meals here are satisfying and unforgettable. For starters, you're treated to some delicious palate-warmers and amuse bouches, like the Tai No Kuro-Toryufu, a carpaccio of gossamer sea bream in an umami dressing of shoyu, seasoned kelp, and black truffle. There's also the famous Onsen Tamago No Gyu ""Marrow"" Furai, an indulgent piece of bone marrow that's fried till crispy edged, but meltingly tender inside, paired with a gloriously wobbly onsen egg in light, citrus-enhanced dashi.
But all this is just a warm-up for the meaty mains, a selection of hand-picked Wagyu beef cuts from all over Japan. There's Tochigi Wagyu, and Saga Prefecture Wagyu, among other selections, each with their own unique ""terroirs"" and flavours, which the chefs will happily tell you all about. Once you've picked your beef, you can choose to have it prepared in a variety of ways: ""Shabu-Shabu"", ""Sukiyaki"", or ""Sumibiyaki"", simply grilled over binchō-tan charcoal.
Regulars know that lunchtime is the best time to hit up this place for some deluxe but wallet-friendly afternoon indulgence: the famous Fat Cow Wagyu Donburi, slices of charcoal-grilled Wagyu served with onsen egg and shredded leeks over pearlescent rice, is served, and boy does it live up to its glorious reputation.

The Fine Line,"We like to think ourselves as simple creatures, wanting nothing more than an easygoing night of sharing a hearty meal and cold brew with friends. And that’s where The Fine Line fits in, emerging as one of our favourite hangouts in the bustling neighbourhood of Holland Village.
A gastropub after our hearts, The Fine Line turns out platters of Western food and booze at severely affordable prices. Kick off your night with yummy appetisers such as the Homemade Crab Cakes that come accompanied with a bright mango salsa. You can’t go wrong with the diner’s Salt & Pepper Squid. Here, squid seasoned with salt, pepper, and sugar, is given a quick sauté in garlic chilli. Famished? Then BBQ Baby back Ribs might be up your alley. Available in either half or full rack, these ribs are slathered in a secret (hint: it’s phenomenal) BBQ sauce and served with a side of baked potato, mashed potatoes, or fries. Out of the many bottled beers available, we like the Californian Sharkinator IPA best for its citrusy notes and refreshing aftertaste.
So gather your friends, chomp down on some shared plates of pizzas and fries, and while the night away in this inviting food joint.
