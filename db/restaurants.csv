"Acqua e Farina","If you’re on the prowl for truly authentic Italian food, look no further than Acqua e Farina. This charming, tastefully decorated restaurant will welcome diners with warm, positive vibes from the moment they step in (think lots of wood and brick in the interiors). Lovely décor wouldn’t mean very much without great grub, though, and we’re happy to say that Acqua e Farina’s mouthwatering list of Italian treats, made from produce mostly imported from Italy, is an absolute delight.
Luxuriate in Italian culinary heaven with dishes like the signature Pizza Acqua e Farina, with its delectable toppings of salami, tomato, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, and sautéed spinach. Each bite will unleash a delicious medley of flavours, and before you know it you’ll be chowing down with unexpected enthusiasm and speed! The pastas aren’t to be sneezed at either – the Spaghetti ai Gamberi is bound to impress with its helpings of oh-so-fresh prawns and a spiciness that gives it extra ‘kick’. Finally, few meals are complete without a dessert to round things off – and if you’re unsure of what to get, why not try the Piatto di Dolci? This platter contains mini portions of Crème Brûlée, Lava Cake, Panna Cotta, and Tiramisu, providing you with a very well-rounded coda to your meal. There are many other dishes on the restaurant’s hefty menu that aren’t mentioned here, so why not nip down and check it out sometime soon? You won’t regret it, we promise!

"Afterglow","If there's one relatively underrated cuisine on the Singapore dining scene, it's raw vegan fare. Vegetarianism's stauncher cousin has gained itself a reputation for not being the tastiest stuff in the world, often relegated to the classification of rabbit food. Afterglow, the hip outpost in the Keong Saik area, aims to change that perception with intriguing, creative raw fare that defies expectations.
Afterglow has hippie chic intentions that go well beyond its inventive decor. The concept was born out of local ingredient sourcing and improving the lifestyles of city dwellers with wholesome, natural fare. Evolving the industrial look with a vintage, trinket-filled aura, the communal space is used to showcase on-theme books, accessories and even wines. This is your first indication that the approach here is not all pious, with additional edge given by artisanal cold brew, small-batch coffee, and craft beer to suit the lively neighborhood after dark.
Regardless of your familiarity with raw vegan dishes, the menu at Afterglow aims to please. To start, the Raw vegan nut 'cheese' platter with crackers uses cultured cashews, soaked and pureed to recreate the smooth texture of a cheesy dip, miraculously sans any actual dairy. The accompanying crackers made of whole seeds and grains deliver a satisfying crunch, and the dip is so tasty that you'd never know it has added probiotic benefits. The sushi-like Afterglow kimchi nori rolls uses faux rice made with almonds and homemade Kimchi that has been stewing in zingy marinades for 7 days. Venturing into Mexican territory, the Raw taco bowl substitutes the seasoned beef for chunky walnuts spiced with a blend of salsas and crunchy purple cabbage, for a refreshing take on usually belt-busting burritos. For a more Italian spin, the Raw lasagne smartly deceives the tongue with zucchini as the pasta sheets, and macerated tomatoes as the sauce.
The Drag-pom salad is ideal for raw-vegan newbies and naysayers alike, featuring an undeniably good combination of dragonfruit with pomegranate, avocado, and macadamia. Also sure to please any palate is the Raw chocolate salted caramel fudge, featuring raw avocado and cacao, layered with sesame-based tahini cream, and a vanilla-medjool sweetened crust for a delightfully guilt-free treat. And really, doesn't that make it all the sweeter?

"Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall","Nestled on the second floor of a conservation shophouse that was once home to dock workers, Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall is a bar that pays homage to Singapore’s migrant history. This is immediately apparent from its decor, from its gold embossed sign with Chinese calligraphy to the deep wooden bar and furniture that’s a throwback to old shipping crates.

At Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall, you can order up a number of locally-inspired concoctions made by bartenders who take the time to craft each drink with utmost care. Some popular drinks include the Ginseng Negroni, featuring a classic negroni with a touch of ginseng. For something more floral, be sure to check out the Osmanthus Sour. Composed of Osmanthus infused gin, honey, and lemon, this sweet brew will brighten anyone’s day. And Singaporeans who grew up on Milo will undoubtedly appreciate the Milo Dinosaur, an adult drink made with Milo-infused bourbon. Then pair your drink with a spread of local street delights, such as a plate of savoury Har Cheong Kai chicken wings or crispy slices of Ngoh Hiang.

Ah Sam Cold Drink Stall is a cocktail bar like no other. Located along the scenic Singapore River, this little establishment combines Singapore’s migrant heritage, amazing local street food, with quality cocktails that will delight any discerning drinker.

"Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments","In our minds, a culinary gem hidden in plain sight would be the best way to describe Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments. Synonymous with its Italian name, 'the Village', this unpretentious Italian Trattoria situated along Bukit Timah is known by its fans for its warm service and rustic Italian fare.
Despite its modest interior of dark wood floors and tiled bricks, the food at Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments is second to none. It should come as no surprise though, judging by Chef Mimmo's insistence on using only the freshest ingredients and making most of the dishes from scratch!
Diners are in for a real treat as Chef Mimmo brings his Italian roots to the plate with a range of classic Napoleon dishes such as Parma, Quattro Formaggi and Bufala Pizza - a thin crusted tomato based pizza baked to perfection and topped with arugula, slices of fresh bufala mozzarella and cherry tomatoes.
Fancy some light evening breeze while sipping on a glass of Bordeaux? Al Borgo @ Alocassia Apartments' al fresco dining area is a hit with its regulars, and it's easy to see why.

"Al Forno (East Coast) Italian Restaurant","A sunny retreat that has been an East Coast staple for 20 years, Al Forno really knows what it's doing when it comes to fresh Italian favourites.
With all the Italian options in Singapore, it's no wonder the competition is stiff enough to see many a restaurant come and go, but Al Forno has stood the test of time and tastiness with a beautifully simple philosophy. Take the freshest Italian ingredients, make dishes that people know and love, and the diners will come. And while it's now a common claim to source ingredients like vine ripened whole tomatoes and peppery parmigiana directly from Italy, Al Forno was the first to do so, with exclusive imports since 1995. That means the dishes here have been tasted, tweaked and perfected so that you can't go wrong with anything on the diligently genuine, yet approachable menu.
The Linguine All' Aragosta, more commonly known as Lobster Linguine, is a house favourite, featuring salty capers and olives punctuating a naturally sweet red sauce made from cherry tomatoes. Succulent chunks of lobster tail and thick noodles of linguine soak up the sauce perfectly. For more of that divine signature sauce, go for the Spaghetti Cartoccio, which is studded with a mix of shelled seafood and baked up in a decadent foil package for two. From the pizzas, the Pizza Con Carne is a knockout, with all forms of meaty deliciousness arranged neatly atop the authentic foldable crust. The Pizza Rollo is a great starter or family pick, featuring a melt of ricotta, spinach and ham all rolled up. Looking quite charming atop their trademark checkered tablecloths, all the dishes taste as good as they look!

That's what Al-Sanobar Lebanese Restaurant promises diners who find themselves supping at their bustling restaurant on Bussorah Street, and boy, do they deliver. From familiar staples like falafel, hummus and baklava, to heartier mains like moussaka and lamb kofta, Al-Sanobar Lebanese Restaurant uses quality ingredients and traditional cooking methods to deliver one memorable meal.
What's more, given that most dishes are grilled, baked, or sautéed in olive oil, you don't have to worry about overindulging.
Their cosy home in one of Singapore's oldest, and most vibrant, cultural neighbourhoods, makes complete sense given their desire to impress with traditional flavours with a touch of modern flair. The al fresco area is perfect for people-spotting, and paves the way for a picturesque meal given the backdrop of one of Singapore's most ornate religious structures, the Sultan Mosque.

From the invitingly open arched doors to the signature blues and whites of the Mediterranean coating the interiors, everything, including the food, will transport you to Greece.

For full authenticity, the produce is brought here, fresh from the Aegean Sea, and items on the menu are crafted by hand, which might explain the depth of flavour in dips like Taramosalata (fish-roe cream) and Melitzanosalata (smoked eggplants with walnuts). Of course, there’s more than pita and dips on the menu. Fill up on amazing Salt-Baked Fresh Fish, grilled gems like the Octopus and Squid – simply named but complex on the tongue – and mains like Kotopoulo Souvlaki (grilled chicken with fried potatoes and yoghurt) as well as Mousaka (minced beef, eggplant, potatoes and béchamel sauce). Even their drinks menu boasts Greek tipples like Mastiha and Ouzo, an uncommon sight in Singapore.

After many years of collaboration between Matteo Trabaldo Togna and Cm Shih in the financial sector, they decided to invest in the F&B business. Two years ago, their joint passion for food and wine led them towards a project in hospitality and in particular with the first Italian fine dining concept in Singapore.
Idyllically located along the iconic cobblestone pathway known as Duxton Hill, diners are greeted with a bustling colonial setting, indoor and outdoor garden seating, and an ever-changing seasonal menu consisting of only the finest and freshest ingredients to contribute to the fantastic Italian dinner fare.
The set lunch is great too. For only S$28.00, diners can escape work to enjoy three courses of freshly prepared dishes.

Plus, they’ve got a sexy bar called the Laundry Room, accessible from a back alley, for some cheeky pre-dinner drinks and speakeasy vibes before tucking into platefuls of creative nosh.

Think small plates like deep fried Brussels Sprouts served with charred miso and sour cream, or Blood Cockles sauteed Vietnam style and served with chili jam, pork crackling, and caramelized fish sauce. We told you. Mains progress to much funkier territory with numbers like the Belly Mussels, a plateful of crisp roast pork belly served with mussels tossed in a sweet and sour chili sauce, and Snails & Marrow, a marriage of two French comfort foods, escargots and beef bone marrow, paired with sweet shallots and garlic rice. Do not miss the chargrilled Beef Short Ribs, falling off the bone and alive with a dressing of coriander, lime, pickles, and piquant Yemeni skhug (a fiery chili sauce).

And no details have been spared here, from the decor that features a sushi counter fashioned from a 180-year-old block of hinoki cypress wood to the imported ingredients flown in from Japan.

Heading this restaurant is none other than Taku Ashino, whose precision and meticulousness help elevate the delicate ingredients them spectacular. Having trained in various sushi restaurants in Tokyo for over a decade, Ashino pays careful attention to making the ingredients sing, grilling his fish over a binchotan grill instead of a gas torch, as well as cooking a blend of Hokkaido and Niigata rice in a traditional iron rice pot with Mount Fuji water to achieve the perfect texture of rice.

Whether you choose a set or omakase menu for lunch, rest assured that you’ll be in good hands. Signature sushi classics make an appearance, from the delectable melt-in-your-mouth Fatty Tuna to the Fresh Salmon Roe that provide bursts of flavour when you bite down on it, leaving you with nothing but a smile on your face.

Eschewing ostentatiousness and swankiness, Ashino is a culinary gem that delivers up delectable sushi not to be found anywhere else in this city. (Dec 2017)

"BAM! Restaurant","We weren't certain it could be done, but BAM! has updated the staid tapas trend back to its former glory, with loud Japanese flavours turning up the volume on dishes that have been there, and done that a few times over. With a hip culture tailor-made for Tras Street, BAM! hits all the high notes.
Merging two cuisines is hardly groundbreaking, however BAM!'s inspired blending of Spanish tapas with small plates that are meant to be shared, and a Japanese sake-flowing izakaya, is spot on. The category is a bit hazy - is it a tapakaya? sakapas? - but whatever you choose to call it, the dining experience here is nothing short of uproarious.
The digs are adequately cool kid-chic, with the requisite hipster trimmings of concrete and not much else. Nude bulbs and the underbelly of the dining room's wiring are starkly exposed. Despite the naked decor, BAM! is not blushing at all with a boldly confident gastronomic vision and spot-on flavours. The vibe draws on the hearty camaraderie of Spanish bars with the real world grit of izakayas, for a pitch-perfect air of laidback dining.
The menu reads like a daily market billboard, hailing the freshest and peak-season ingredients. There are some mainstays though that have earned their permanent placement. The Pasta a la Plancha with Prawn and Sake Butter is next-level umami, with just enough acidity from the wine. And sake doesn't just make a one-time appearance, with a glassed-in cooler of both popular and hard-to-find brands.

"Bao Boy","Joining the patty action in town is Bao Boy, the latest opening by chef Andrew Walsh of Cure and Butcher Boy. Fronted by a neon-lit #IncrediBAO sign and dressed in textured concrete walls and brass tones, this trendy restaurant fits right in with the busy Hong Kong Street.

The menu is inspired by burgers, but crafted with the Asian steamed bun (bao). The fluffy white bread is filled with a variety of interesting combinations, from the vegetarian Chickpea Falafel Bao to the Lamb Bao. The former shows off a crunchy patty with a soft, creamy middle, topped with a nutty house-fermented harissa sauce and sesame tahini. Fans of Vietnamese food should try the Pulled Pork Banh Mi Bao — deliciously-marbled Iberico pork jowl is cooked until meltingly tender, then topped with a rich and creamy liver parfait, drizzled with spicy sriracha.

Besides the signature bao, Bao Boy also serves up a selection of snacks for pre-dinner nibbles. Try the Salmon Tartare Nachos, a bright and vibrant dish of fresh fish dressed in a tangy marinade, with crisp tortilla chips for crunch.

Wash down your dinner with an ice-cold beer from the drinks list of premium brews, or savour a wickedly potent cocktail such as the Ryokucha, featuring roasted green tea-infused gin with Campari and a splash of vermouth. (Jul 2019)

"Bar-Roque Grill","Bar-Roque Grill at the Amara Hotel is the actualisation of a dream many years in the making. Chef Stephane Istel was determined to open his own restaurant by the time he was thirty-five years old, and the food on offer at the modern rotisserie and bar provides an intimate insight into the experiences that have made the man.
The heart of the menu, of course, is made up of the meats from the rotisserie. Both the French Free Range Chicken and Australian Pork knuckle have won rave reviews, and we could definitely understand why. But don't fixate on just those items though, because while the rotisserie may be the heart, Chef Stephane's deft touch and heartfelt recipes are the soul of what's on offer. Whether it be the tarte flambee, signature to his home town of Alsace, or his mother's apple pie recipe, there's a delicate balance of tradition and modernity in the food and the decor that makes the entire experience undeniably unique.
And when you finally look up from your empty plate, sated and satisfied, contemplate the open kitchen and the stoic, rustic materials of stone, wood, and cement. There's a soft harmony to the design that maintains an elegant poise, a perfect mirror to the generous food served by Chef Stephane paired with the impeccable service directed by manager Kori Millar.

"The Beast","For a heaping serving of Southern charm in Singapore, there's no place like The Beast off Arab Street. Featuring artisan Bourbon flights and stick-to-your-ribs soul food, it's sure to tame your beast of an appetite.

Wrapped around a corner of Jalan Klapa, The Beast is a pint-sized space with gallons of flavour. Kick-started by local entrepreneur Jamie Koh of The Chupitos Bar fame, the barn-like eatery is an ode to her college days in Atlanta, Georgia. And some fun times those must have been, judging by the heavy influence of Kentucky-sourced bourbon whisky, including their signature and self-explanatory Baconator shot. The narrow ground floor area is raw and rustic, save for a trendy marquee sign along the inner wall. You could also opt for a roomier dining area upstairs, or for an alfresco barrel-topped table along the walking path.

While it's a space built for fun times and honky-tonk, the food takes its tradition of Southern hospitality very seriously. You'd be hard-pressed to find such true-blue Southern specialties as fluffy buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy and Cajun-spiced shrimp and grits anywhere else in the city, let alone such superb versions. Though the reputation for Southern fare starts with fried chicken and ends with extra butter (Paula Deen-style), The Beast features a complete array of the diverse flavours for which the region is so popular for. If you haven't tried these dishes before, consider this your warning that this stuff is habit-forming, and though not diet-friendly, definitely worth the splurge.

Go for their new brunch menu, when those fresh-from-the-oven biscuits are on display, stuffed with drool-worthy fillings like crispy battered chicken and slow cooked pulled pork. Also noteworthy are the classic Chicken & Waffles, the Mac & Cheese Burger and savoury Cornbread. Washed down with icy Sweet Tea, or all you can drink Mimosas at $30, that's some really good eatin' y'all!

"Bella Pasta","An offshoot of the immensely popular Bella Pizza, its sister restaurant next door, Bella Pasta takes the pizza kitchen’s fine nose for good flavour, steady Italian-trained hands, and generous love for everything rich and creamy, and dishes out a heavy-hitting menu of delicious pasta plates.

If you’ve ever chowed down on the deluxe pizzas at Bella Pizza, you know you’re in for a treat. Here, there’s a full Italian menu including pastas and charcoal grilled meats, turned out by a highly-trained team of chefs drawn from top Italian restaurants all over the island. Dine alfresco to really soak up the Robertson Quay vibes, but also because pasta tastes better with a side of people watching - and you’ll be doing a lot of people watching, because one plate won’t be enough. Think chewy batons of Cavatelli pasta tossed with wilted spinach and salty Parma Ham or a bountiful Linguine Frutti de Mare, a garlicky toss-up of linguine and tender shrimp, clams, and squid. One of the highlights is a beautiful, generous portion of Pappardelle Boscoiala, ribbony strips of pasta in a rich, tomato-based mushroom sauce. Beyond pasta, fill up on their hefty charcoal grilled meats and seafood. A particularly attractive Grigliata Gamberi E Calamari sees smoky grilled squid and fleshy big prawn served with little other than a squeeze of lemon and their own juices with fresh arugula.

River breeze, hot pasta, and the capable hands of an Italian kitchen - Singapore rarely gets better than this.

"Bella Pizza","Along Robertson Quay, which overflows with one great foodie option after another, this winning pizzeria stands out for its excellent gourmet-inflected pizzas, made lovingly with Italian ingredients and exacting Italian taste. Grab a seat in the alfresco area and you could almost be on a Roman street, soaking up the sights, sounds, and, most importantly, smells. Here, the pizza is made fresh by hand in the Neapolitan style, meaning the crust has the perfect balance between chewiness and crispiness. That sweet spot is probably why the pizzas here are regularly touted amongst some of the best in town. Obviously it’s not just about the crust: imagine the sinful appeal of a pizza crowned by wobbly mounds of creamy Burrata cheese, or topped with an elegant fan of thinly sliced salmon on a bed of spinach. If all that’s too rich, reach for the bright flavours of anchovies, capers, and tomatoes in their Napoleon pizza, or the simple pleasures of Gorgonzola, browned onions, and Mozzarella in the Pizza Cipolla. There’s also pastas, like the especially indulgent Truffle-bomb, Fettuccine Salciccia Fe Tartufo, where noodles are tossed in a truffle cream, topped with freshly-shaved black truffle. It’s very hard to top the joy of pizza, but here it becomes an art.

"Birds of a Feather","It’s easy to mistake Birds of a Feather for yet another pretty cafe. The space is filled with natural light from two air-well openings, and hand-crafted art pieces and copper pipes are a chic finish to the walls here.

But the dishes here are far from the typical Eggs Benedict or pancake stack. Instead, the food is a delicious fusion of Western with Sichuan influences. Take the Yuxiang (fish fragrance). The sauce is traditionally made by frying doubanjiang, garlic and ginger with pickled chilli, served with meaty eggplants. At Birds of a Feather, the same dish comes with an extra layer of mozzarella cheese, and a generous sprinkle of mantou crumbs.
If you’re a big fan of spicy food, items like the Fortune Skewers are a must-order. This crowd favourite has gotten a new twist, and now comes with a fiery Sichuan red oil. Birds of a Feather specially pick their spices from Chengdu’s spice market, and these are laboriously  fried with chillies to create this house-made oil.

Not all Sichuan dishes are numbingly spicy, either. The Sichuan Oxtail Soup is a light, clear broth, akin to the familiar pig’s trotters soup. Chinese herbs and fresh leek infuse this comforting soup with plenty of flavour.

Just looking for a relaxed night out, with drinks and some simple grub? The street food-inspired selection is the perfect bar snack. Definitely order the Charcoal Grilled Pork Bits. Inspired by barbecued pork belly skewers sold along the streets, Birds of a Feather does a luxe version with Duroc pork belly, crispy rice crackers, charred green chilli, and Japanese sweet potato.

"Blue Lotus @ Sentosa Cove","A popular destination for chilli crab lovers, Blue Lotus @ Sentosa Cove in Quayside Isle, is the perfect escape from the urban jungle that is Singapore's city centre, and a well-loved departure from your usual chilli crab hotspots.
Garnering rave reviews for their skillfully prepared dishes, it's pretty clear that this joint is more than just a dining destination with a stunning view. The Blue Lotus Signature Chilli Pomelo Crab - what can be considered their claim to fame - has people flocking from far and wide just for a taste. Simmered with lemongrass and curry leaves, and with just enough chilli to give it a kick - it's one creation we can't get enough of. And don't even get us started on their Wok Fried Kagoshima Wagyu Beef Tenderloin served with peppercorn. Using half-cooked well-marbled beef which is then put into a heated stone bowl to finish cooking, get ready for a piping hot bowl of deliciousness.
To end the meal opt for one of their unique dessert choices. The Lemon Gelo served with a lime sorbet, one of our favourites, is a refreshing treat. With an invigorating citrus punch and a sweet jelly base, it's one dessert you'll be craving for days to come!

"Blue Pier","Unsurprisingly, a bevy of seafood restaurants line up along East Coast Parkway but Blue Pier stands out for its super-fresh seafood and inventive dishes. Dine outdoors for maximum enjoyment - it cannot get any better than indulging in some live seafood and traditional Chinese barbecue dishes while enjoying the sweet coastal breeze. Prefer the indoors? The nautical-themed decor’s sure to get you in the mood for some delish seafood.

Singapore’s world-renowned chilli crab is given due respect here with its thick, luscious gravy that’s not too sweet and not too spicy. Don’t forget to scoop up all that precious sauce with some fried mantous! Other uber fresh delights include the Signature Sarawak Black Pepper Crab, the Spiced Salt Red Grouper Fish Head, and the irresistible Mala Small Lobster. The Beijing Crispy Duck’s strictly not in the seafood department, but is executed well nonetheless, with a crisp, aromatic skin and some juicy, succulent meat that sure does not disappoint.

Still not sure what to order? Maybe the restaurant’s resident robot, Lucy, can help. Programmed to serve food, she can even dance to some catchy tunes, making for some good techy entertainment that both kids and adults will find intriguing. (Aug 2018)

Kick off with small plates like Kampong Fried Chicken Wings, Salted Pepper Squid, Masala Spiced Fried Fish Cutlets, and Butter Chickpeas, which will give you a sense of the sure-handed East-meets-West cuisine on offer here. Mains evolve into comforting plates like DIY pasta plates where you match your favourite pasta to your favourite sauce. Dunk some Fettuccine in their delectable Meatball Pomodoro Sauce or a heady Puttanesca, or have some Pappardelle tossed up in that Roman classic: Cacio E Pepe, a humble but gut-punching mix of fresh cheese and insane amounts of black pepper.

Their state of the art Beechwood Stone Hearth turns out perfect pizzas, and the flavours here are bolder than you might get at other pizzaries. Think a no-holds barred Anchovies pizza, strewn with melty buffalo mozzarella and sous-vide eggs, or a salty Pepperoni e Salami, the twin sausages of Italian life paired with capers and piquant tomatoes. For a more carnal approach, order off the grill, with numbers like a juicy New York Strip Steak and a tender Baby Lamb Rack Au Jus sure to sate your carnivorous streak. Craft beers, Japanese whiskies, and punchy cocktails may have to do in place of dessert, because the night is young, and what else are you going to do with that food coma? (Feb 2018)

"boCHINche","boCHINche in the city’s foremost Argentine restaurants, bringing the robust hearty cuisine of Argentina to a country that isn’t terribly familiar with its flavours and traditions. Located along sexy Amoy Street, the little quartier of the city that’s leading Singapore’s culinary revolution, the restaurant provides a great mix of laid back lounge vibes and upmarket dining experiences. In other words: sexy cocktails and delicious food. The menu brings the traditional fare of an Argentine bistro to the table, but gives it a modern makeover. One thing that remains, though, is the pride of place given to the custom-made wooden charcoal grill that infuses everything it touches with its signature smoky kiss.

So what is Argentine food? Think croquettes studded with smoky, spicy Chorizo, smoked peppers, and slices of duck ham served with preserved cherries and a cream of pecorino cheese. Classic Argentine empanadas come stuffed with braised cuttlefish, fragrant fennel, and chorizo, or savoury-sweet goat’s cheese with spinach, raisins, and pine nuts. Seafood mains are the next order of business, with plates like charcoal-grilled octopus served with crunchy fennel, new potatoes & samphire salad, and a homey tuna mayo. Argentine beef, the pride of the nation and, indeed, of this kitchen, comes in the form of the Caracu, a beef & marrow bone burger paired with braised ox cheeks, and a piquant salad of tomatoes, onions, and house pickles. For dessert, there’s none other than the fabled Dulce de Leche Creme Brulee & Banana Split Ice Cream, a combination of some of childhood’s favourite flavours: sweet toffee and creamy banana. Or maybe just wind down with one of the bar’s famous cocktails, like the boCHINche Sour, made from Amaretto-like Disaronno, apricot brandy, and lemon juice for a smooth and potent end to the meal. This is a gourmet experience close to the heart of Singapore’s new culinary wave, shot through with an Argentine love of good food, fine wines, and long, luxuriant dinners. (Nov 2017)

That’s the deal here at Bodacious, and the name describes pretty much everything about this place, from its glitzy and contemporary diner vibe to its menu of meaty burgers, pastas, and steaks. Here, breakfast means sidling up to a hulking platter of meatballs served up with baked eggs seasoned with zingy harissa, or the restaurant’s signature Eggs Benedict, a plate overflowing with globes of hollandaise-topped poached eggs, smoked salmon, juicy grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, and English muffins. Later in the day, burgers, including a particularly delectable Tofu Burger, fly out of the kitchen, followed swiftly by nifty twists on classic Western plates like battered cod with sweet potato chips and a salted egg yolk dip, or a flower-clam studded spaghetti tossed in piquant laksa sauce. A juicy Tenderloin Steak & Fries, as well as a crisp-skinned Duck Confit, round up this menu of Western favourites, and if you’re audacious enough, you can finish it all off with a thick serving of Shibuya Toast loaded with salted butter and ice cream.

There's casual, and then there's Boiler-style casual. The kind of casual that lets you get down and dirty, in the tastiest way possible, with your meal. The Boiler features a laidback set up, allowing you to choose your fresh seafood to be boiled to order.

Next, choose a sauce ranging from slightly piquant to can't-feel-your-lips spicy. Your sack of goodies is prepared and then poured directly onto the paper-topped table. Formality is tossed aside along with the shells as you dig in to get to every nook and cranny of the succulent seafood, taking the phrase ""finger-licking good"" very literally. Bibs are included.
Located near the tourist attractions like the Singapore Flyer and Merlion, The Boiler is a real find for lunch, when the usual seafood feast is fine-tuned to the mid-day meal. Tidy but still decadent dishes like Fish & Chips, the Ultimate Burger with caramelized onions, and Prawn Pasta Soup are great options.

"Brasserie Les Saveurs","When it comes to old world charm and turn of the century opulence, nobody does it quite like the St Regis. And nothing harkens to the good old days of the big city hotel like a magnificent French restaurant. Brasserie Les Saveurs is the resident restaurant of the St Regis and is a stunning chamber festooned with gold trim, velvet drapes, floor-to-ceiling windows, and a beautiful crystal chandelier bearing witness to the intimate goings-on below. Expect nothing less than the most traditional and time-honoured of French plates. Kick off with some bubbly and oysters from its raw bar, a selection of different regional oysters from around the world, served with tart vinaigrette. Follow that up with one of its elegant entrees, like a notoriously tricky to prepare Foie Gras Au Torchon, a roll of foie gras coated with pistachios and apricots, and served with brioche. Or a plate of vivid Red Beetroot Gnocchi, tender little mounds served with nutty browned butter, black truffle, macadamia nut, and a foam of goat’s cheese.

And that’s just the entrees! The mains here are a selection of the finest regional plates from France. Think a beautiful cocotte of Seafood Bouillabaisse, filled with tantalizing seafood like monkfish, scallop, mussels, and prawn, perfumed with aromatic fennel, and served with a fiery rouille of garlic and peppers. Nothing gets more traditionally French than a delicate Whole Dover Sole Meuniere, one of the great classics of the repertoire, the creamy-fleshed sole browned in butter before being blanketed in a tart lemon-butter sauce, coated with piquant capers and haricots verts. Red meat here comes in the form of rack of lamb, herb-crusted and served on a bed of heady morels and a Provençal corn galette, as well as an Oven-Roasted Breast of Duck, served “à l’Orange” over a bed of sweet turnips. For a super premium dinner, choose from an entire menu of various aged wagyu steaks, prepared in the classic French style with lots of butter, herbs, and a serving of potatoes. If you’ve got room for dessert, zoom in for the Chocolat “Millefeuille,” an indulgent confection that explodes in your mouth with a range of textures and an unbeatable bittersweet finish. If you’re going to go French, indulge a little and go the whole mile at this old world charmer.

"Brunches Cafe","Trying to look for Brunches Café but can’t seem to find it? No worries - spot the unique 4-seater sofa set converted from an original vintage Mini Cooper!  Decorated with all sorts of retro knick-knacks and furnishings, Brunches Café is a vintage-themed café that specialises in delicious breakfast food, gourmet sandwiches, and great beverages.

The stars of the show are definitely the all-day breakfast items. The Fluffy Pancake Stacks fly out of the kitchen and into the stomachs of ravenous diners - perfectly soft, deeply flavoured and the best start to the lazy weekend, these pancakes are served with sweet seasonal fruits, fresh butter and addictive maple syrup. The Eggs Benedict is not to be missed either - 2 beautifully poached eggs with runny centres are placed atop a bed of Arugula leaves and a generous serving of streaky bacon. The homemade hollandaise sauce poured over the bouncy eggs manages to get the proportion of egg yolk, liquid butter, water, and lemon juice exactly correct, resulting in a dish that is soul-satisfying! As for the desserts, the Molten Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream is nothing short of amazing. Warm, liquid chocolate oozes out from the centre of the mini chocolate cake when cut open, complemented perfectly by the ice-cold vanilla ice cream.

"Buko Nero","Mention to Singapore foodie friends that you have found a tiny down-to-earth place where, for the past 16 years, the owners themselves have put their own Asian twist on mind-blowingly amazing Italian food, and it’s likely that the name Buko Nero will pop up. One-of-a-kind in terms of its compact dynamism, Buko Nero prides itself on serving food that they themselves would want to eat, if they were the customer. The wife, Tracy, who is Singaporean, handles the front of the restaurant, while the husband, Oscar, an Italian, is the chef. Together, they have created something that is semi-legendary in the Singapore dining scene because of the quality of food and the waiting list for this restaurant.

Top of the list of recommendations for this unique establishment is the Buko Nero Tau Kwa Tower with sauteed vegetables and Asian dressing, which was created as a stacked dish consisting of vegetables such as parsley, carrots, and enoki mushrooms layered atop a big piece of tau kwa (firm tofu). Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soya sauce) is drizzled over it, giving the entire concoction an extra oomph. Deceptively simple, this dish has won fans because of its unique flavour combination and freshness of vegetables used. The Baked Fillet of Cod, which is presented with a crust made of olives and a sweet bell pepper coulis, has also won praise for its simple yet effective use of basic ingredients. For cosy Italian fare in the heart of Singapore, it is hard to find a more intimate, homely dining experience than this well-loved restaurant that serves food straight from the heart.

Even the simply dressed Rombo is worth raving about. Using fresh line caught wild Turbot, filling it with Sicilian Red Prawn, and topping it off with black rice crust - it’s got immense flavour without being overdone.
And as always, no Italian dining experience is complete without a plate of pasta so be sure to save room for their Tagliolini ai Pioppini.

"Butcher Boy","Relish the relaxed, casual vibe at Butcher Boy; this meat-lover’s haven is one to visit for its tasty, Asian-inspired cocktails, good music, and its great selection of meaty treats (of course). Named after Chef-Owner Andrew Walsh’s favourite movie The Butcher Boy, the restaurant places its specialty front and centre – and boy is the meat good.
Try not to swoon as you tuck into a helping of Black Angus Tender Valley Rib Eye – tender, luscious, and perfect with a generous slather of the house rendition of XO sauce, it’s an all-round mouthwatering dish that you’ve got to try. You can’t go wrong with the salt-baked and grilled Crispy Skin Pork Belly either – a comforting favourite complete with a good, solid crackling. A sauce would be a lovely touch as well; the restaurant’s list of Asian-influenced sauces are big on taste and serve to perfectly complement the meats. If you’re looking for something that’s not all just meat, however, then don’t forget to peruse the list of baos and sides (think Tomato, Tofu, Onion Dashi). And of course, complete your meal with a drink on the side – the Plum Sloe Gin Fizz is deliciously tangy and a definite must-try, and the Smoking Carriage is an impressive number you do not want to miss! So for a tipple, some great grills, and a relaxing dining experience, you can’t do much better than Butcher Boy, really.

The Chilled Almond Soup is the perfect way to start a meal here; creamy and velvety, this cold broth is laced with sweet slivers of crab meat, apples, and coriander for a punchy kick. Carry on with satisfying mains like the Chestnut Pappardelle. The thick-cut flat pasta is made in-house daily using ground chestnut flour and has a good bite that supports the rich veal ragu.

"Byblos Grill","Busy Bussorah Street plays host to a bunch of Middle Eastern restaurants, and Byblos Grill is one of the true hidden gems amongst them. Helmed by Chef Mohamad Salim, who brings true craft and authenticity to his Lebanese cuisine, made with imported Lebanese ingredients and spices, and served up in a truly homey style. In the tradition of a true mezza, begin with a sharing platter of some of the most beautiful hummus in town: topped with a party of pine nuts, herbs, minced lamb, and olive oil, this creamy hummus, eaten with crisp pita, is heaven on earth. Alongside that, a mezze platter of Babaganoush, Labneh, Moussaka, and Arabic Salad, gives you extra pita-dipping options, and all this before the main course of grilled meats. From fragrant, smoky Lamb Kofta to tender Shish Taouk (chicken breast in a zesty marinade), nothing speaks of the Middle East quite like its stunning array of grilled, marinated meats. But it’s the charcoal-grilled Lamb Chops, paired with spicy harissa, grilled vegetables, and rice that makes for a truly climactic moment: the smoky, meaty flavours are brought out perfectly by the zingy harissa, and the meat comes off the bone in chewy, tender bites. A vibrant meal in one of the most vibrant parts of Singapore, Middle Eastern fare is making a comeback: come see why!

"béni Singapore","béni, a French term which translates to ""blessing"", offers one of the most exclusive epicurean experiences available in Singapore, showcasing fine authentic French cuisine with a Japanese touch.

Chef Kenji's thoughtfully crafted discovery menus feature fresh produce, with meats and fish sourced and flown in from artisanal producers in Japan, and seasonal fresh vegetables from France. Highlights include Kenji's signature Amadai dish. The Amadai fish from Kyoto Prefecture is cooked in the traditional ""Matsukasayaki"" style where the scales are left on the fish and fried to a crisp resembling pine cones. This gives the fish a very unique combination of crispy and tender textures. While the cooking method remains the same, Chef Kenji comes up with new flavours to pair the Amadai with, based on the season, a reflection of his dedication to the craft.

"Caffe Fernet","Hurrah, the Jigger & Pony Group have done it again! The brilliant minds behind some of our favourite cocktail spots such as Jigger & Pony, Sugarhall, and Gibson, have created an exciting dining concept that we absolutely adore.
Situated in the historic Customs House by the uber-scenic waterfront, Caffe Fernet is a beautiful 130-seater establishment where Italian-inspired nibbles and drinks are served with style and flair. On good days, we prefer to opt for the casual and breezy alfresco dining area where  we can sip on a drink while enjoying views of the Marina Bay skyline.
The food here promises to be fresh and exciting. Instead of the heavy, traditional Italian nosh, Caffe Fernet takes these tried-and-true Italian flavours and breathes into them fresh life. Indulge in delightful plates such as the minimalistic Cacio e Pepe that showcases nothing but freshly cracked black pepper and high-grade cheese. Looking for finger food instead? Then opt for the delightful morsels of Tomato Poppers or a bowl of Olives. And be sure to order up an evergreen cocktail such as a Spritz or Negroni that never goes out of style.

"Caffé B","Moving from the glitz of the Marina Bay Sands to the old-world-meets-new-world charm of Club Street, Caffe B is one of the island’s best-kept secrets, loved by regulars for its cocktails and refined Japanese-meets-Italian cuisine. Now the environs are more chill, expanded, and located in one of the trendiest parts of town, which makes it a triply more exciting experience. Kick off a meal here with a sinful Espresso Martini as you wait for your first course to arrive. A dome-shaped Burrata Cheese arrives at the table wobbling with the promise of its creamy insides, best enjoyed mopped up with wedges of heirloom tomatoes on the side. Then there’s the refined Espelette Octopus Salad, featuring grilled octopus legs alongside a piquant and fruity espelette sauce, a Mediterranean flavour combination made in heaven. The ocean theme continues with a plate of grilled King Prawns served atop a bed of crunchy and sweet baby vegetables.

The signature Risotto Singapore features a crown of scallops and uni, the whole dish bathed in a saffron-kissed stock, giving way to creamy, umami mouthfuls, while the Tagliatelle Carbonara features tangles of pasta coated with eggy cream, flecked with bits of truffle and a heady topping of freshly shaved Parmesan cheese. For dessert, nothing short of the Tiramisu, except it’s a deconstructed version featuring a dome of Mascarpone ice cream over a scattering of chocolate and coffee cake, coffee gelee, and raspberry coulis. Sure-handed cuisine, an elegant dining room, and punchy cocktails worth their weight in glassware, this is a worthy addition to the gems along Club Street. (Jan 2018)

"Cajun on Wheels (Plaza Singapura)","It may seem a little counter-intuitive at first, but think of this as a Cajun food truck that’s decided to hang up its wheels and stay put, serving up platefuls of delicious Cajun goodness in a comfy restaurant setting. Louisiana-style seafood is the highlight here, featuring steamed, deep-fried, and baked treasures of the sea given a heavy hit of zesty Cajun spice, and then eaten off a large communal tray for maximum enjoyment. You’ve got the classic Cajun on Wheels Crab, crustaceans drenched in a rich and buttery Cajun sauce, fleshy Lobster & Prawns given a lick of spice the enhance their natural sweetness, and briny Mussels given a quick steam to tenderise their flesh then doused in lashings of fragrant seasoning. Beyond Cajun spices, there’s also creamy sauces like Thai Red Curry and even Salted Egg Yolk to enhance your enjoyment.
If you have a hard time picking your seafood, opt for one of their magnificent platters, the chief of which is the Olympian Bucket, a no-frills metal pail filled to the brim with seafood goodness and crowned with a massive crab with a cheese gratin on its back. For very large parties and appetites, there is the Cajun on Wheels Spread, which features several buckets of seafood, platters of grilled fish, with some burgers slapped on for good measure. The aromas, generosity, and communal-style dining throws you right into the Southwest, where pleasure, greed, and the love of good food are ways of life.

"Candlenut","Warm, full-bodied, and complex are often adjectives people use describe the beloved and traditional Peranakan cuisine. At Candlenut, this uniquely Southeast Asian cuisine is getting its time in the limelight thanks to chef-owner Malcolm Lee’s deft work and skill that garnered him a Michelin star two years in a row.

With high ceilings, clean lines, and plenty of sunshine, it’s almost impossible to feel stressed in the relaxed and laidback atmosphere that Candlenut exudes. While this 92-seater establishment includes a private room for more intimate dinners, guests also have the option of sitting in the al fresco area for a night under the stars.

There are a fair number of classic Peranakan dishes on a menu that spans across 40 appetisers, mains, and desserts. Be prepared to fall head over heels for standouts such as the Red Lion Snapper, accompanied by fresh chilli sambal and charred garlic chives. The King Tiger Prawn, featuring local ingredients such as gula melaka coconut sauce, lemongrass, and Thai basil, is also another hit. Of course, indecisive eaters can always go for the playfully-named Ah-Ma-Kase tasting menu to sample a little of everything.

With a new home at the ultra-hip COMO Dempsey, Candlenut promises a night (or afternoon) filled with contemporary Straits-Chinese cuisine amid the lush greenery that is Dempsey Hill.

Captain K Seafood Tower combines a selection of luscious seafood, Korean flavours, and an excitingly unusual seafood tower concept to make for a delicious, satisfying dining experience you won’t be forgetting in a hurry.

Choose from three different soup bases: the classic Kombu Dashi base, homemade Korean Kimchi soup base, and Premium Korean Ginseng Chicken soup base. Then, decide on how many tiers you would like for your tower, with a minimum of three tiers and a maximum of nine, and this is where it starts to get really interesting. Delicious helpings of seafood are steamed in each tier from top to bottom (the tiers are stacked on top of the soup base), and the resulting flavourful juices are collected in the base, adding a richness of taste that will prove oh-so-delectable. And don’t forget, you can still dig into a freshly-cooked serving of Blue Mussels, or Crab, or whatever it is you so choose. From Prawns, to Half-Shell Scallops, to Clams, it’s a veritable treasure trove of the fruits of the sea, and as fresh as you please.

"Carnivore Brazilian Churrascaria (CHIJMES)","Forget the meat-and-potatoes steakhouse. A lively Brazilian churrascaria is what you should seek for an eventful and delicious evening out.

The idea is simple. You sit down, and passadors bearing skewers of grilled premium meat, carve moist slivers directly onto your plate. Beef, chicken, lamb, fish – there's no need to limit yourself. It's an endless flow of meaty goodness where all you have to do is sit, and eat. And eat. And eat. Just when your palate is starting to feel a little jaded, you order a portion of grilled caramelised pineapple whose sharp, tangy sweetness is the perfect way to whet your appetite all over again. All so you can get back to those delicious cuts of meat.

Don't just be dazzled by the succulent barbecued meats, rotisserie-cooked to perfection. There's also a buffet spread that shouldn't be overlooked! With staples like salads and pastas, it's where you should turn to if you feel that you've met your match on the protein front.

The meat though, is undeniably the draw of this restaurant, and with a name like Carnivore, that shouldn't be a surprise.

Someone has clearly heard your prayers, because Cast Iron features exactly that - an exquisite Japanese ‘cold bar’ alongside a fiery, smoky Gaucho Grill, and a menu of delicate small plates that spans the range from ocean fresh sashimi and sushi to fresh-off-the-grill cuts of meat, seafood, and vegetables. Whet your appetite with some Japanese whisky or sake, and chow down on a beautifully presented Salmon Spicy Uramaki before pursuing some tender cuts of seasonal sashimi, directly imported from Japanese seafood markets.

Then warm up the palate with some grilled small plates, like an exquisite helping of grilled Razor Clams paired with garlic, chili, shallots and fine herbs, or gamey Quail, brushed with an orange & clove reduction, herbal tarragon, and almonds. An Iberico Pork Chop arrives fresh off the coals with a punchy chorizo chili jam, and crunchy pickled fennel, while Jumbo Prawns are flame-seared and arrive in a French-Thai melange of tarragon, vermouth, and som tam (spicy papaya salad). The other grill items are done Robata style, or “slow-grill” style, to get the best texture out of premium cuts of meat like Iberico Pork, Wagyu, and vegetables like Lady’s Fingers, Hokkaido Corn, and Japanese Sweet Potatoes.

If it’s not clear by now, the philosophy of this restaurant is to take quality produce and give it the barest touch to elevate its natural textures and flavours. Take yourself through an entire sensory experience at Cast Iron, a true gem in Singapore’s already busy dining scene. (Feb 2018)

Although this outlet is much smaller than the original in Thomson, it makes for a cosier environment with al-fresco seating options.

The draw of this spot is their unique flavour of prata. The leavened bread dish is soft, tender, and served hot. Most of the pratas come with thick daal to dip into, and make for a memorable meal. Try the Cheese Prata - served piping hot and perfect with the warm spice of the daal. Diners who are feeling a little more adventurous can opt for a non-traditional flavour, like Chicken Floss, or Banana Chocolate.

If you’re dining with just one other person, the set meals are the way to go. Try the Fish Head Set Meal - it comes with rice, drinks, and pappadam, as well as a generous serving of the famed fish head curry. The gravy is tangy and flavourful, and the fish in this dish tends to absorb flavour from the spices used, which give the meat an earthy taste.

"Catchfly","The Singapore cocktail revolution continues with this super-sharp looking and sexy American-style cocktail bar that joins the liquor belt along Ann Siang Street with its menu of expertly hand-crafted cocktails, swinging vibes, and delicious modern bar bites.
The drinks come courtesy of the genius mind of head bartender Liam Baer, and they feature some nifty gourmet touches that make these more than a get-drunk-quick tipple. Think complex numbers like Salad Days, which features summer-ripe tomatoes that are steeped, sous vide, in gin to create a vibrant base that’s layered with grapefruit-kissed liquor, herbal French vermouth, and a touch of smoked olive oil and pink peppercorn for a zany, tomatoey martini that may just be good for you. Then there’s This One Works With Tequila, which takes your choice of spirit (Tequila recommended) and fizzes it up with homemade salted grapefruit soda before being topped with a garnish of cucumber and dill. For something less vegetal, there’s The Honey Badger, a burnished, honeyed sunset of a drink featuring rosemary-infused bourbon, herbal chartreuse, and touches of lemon, ginger, and honey.
With so much herbal flourish in the drinks, you’d be right to guess the food is an all out naughty pigfest: think hearty plates like the Kimchi Beef Chilli & Corn Chips that give you mouthful after mouthful of meaty, spicy indulgence. This well could be one of the sexiest spots along Ann Siang to get your drink game on, plus points if you’re a cocktail nerd and want to experience some exciting new flavours in your crystal-cut glass.

"The Cavern Horsecity","Unpretentious and low-key, The Cavern Horsecity is the place to knock back a couple of cool brews or dig into some hearty pub grub as you cheer on your favourite football team on telly.
The extensive menu at The Cavern Horsecity is eclectic, spanning across local favourites, Western dishes, and a variety of finger food. We like the Anchovies Fried Rice that features a generous serving of fried rice, grilled chicken sausage, sautéed vegetables, sambal belachan, and topped with a warm fried egg. Craving for carbs? You won’t go wrong with the Vongole Pasta, with olive oil-slicked clams and prawns sitting on a bed of spaghetti or fettuccini. To satiate any possible munchies, The Cavern Horsecity offers plenty of bar grub too. A dish worth mentioning is the ever-popular Fried Shrimp where plump, juicy shrimps are coated with breadcrumbs and deep-fried to crispy, finger-licking perfection.

Using the freshest ingredients sourced from Thailand and local markets, Central Thai Restaurant is consistently whipping up crowd-pleasing halal Thai food in its Changi Airport Terminal 2 home.
Like any home-style cooking, the food tastes best when shared among friends and family. We can’t get enough of the Combination Platter, where you get to sample a variety of appetisers such as Thai Fish Cake, Prawn Cake, Thai-style Satay, and Mini Spring Rolls. The Thai  Seafood Glass Noodle Salad is another noteworthy dish, which pairs perfectly-seared squid and prawns with glass noodles, assorted vegetables, and a tangy citrusy dressing.
Crazy about curry? Then try the eatery’s Green Curry Chicken. This mild curry packs a moreish punch thanks to ingredients such as lemongrass, shallots, and coriander. An assortment of rice and noodle dishes are also available for the pickings, with evergreen favourites such as Stir-fried Thai Flat Rice Noodle and Thai Pineapple Fried Rice. So why wait?

"Chachako","Meet Chachako, a free-spirited and adventurous chef who scours the world to bring home the most glorious grills and fares from all corners.

Chachako's journey began a few years ago. Tired of cooking the same dishes, she picked up her bags and started her quest to look for the best meal in the world. From Asia, Europe to the Americas, her search led her to foods she has never tasted, reclaiming unexpected palates, flavours and sensations.

Soon, she realised that the best meal does not have a label or a nationality; it is simply a good time over food that is cooked with love.
Inspired by her journeys, she created a distinctive blend of Asian-infused, home-style grill that is eclectic, quirky and full of surprises. From spices, recipes to presentation, Chachako wants her food to remind you of a mouth-watering, home-cooked meal that is best enjoyed when it is shared with others.

"Chao Chao Gyoza","If you can’t get enough of these deep-fried delights, there’s finally a place to sate your cravings. Founded in Osaka in 1971, this historic restaurant pays homage to the beloved Japanese dumpling. The recipe was perfected by Kenzo Nishi and the basic ingredients have not been modified since. Every single dumpling is filled with the right amount of filling and is fried to crisp perfection without a hint of greasiness.

The gyoza here are stuffed with a variety of fillings and topped with everything from cheese to citrus sauce. Vegetarians will be glad to know that Cabbage Gyoza is also on the menu. Diners looking for a unique dish can try the Ponzu Buta Gyoza - a delicious serving of pork gyoza drenched in a citrus and ponzu sauce. The combination may sound off-putting to some, but don’t knock it till you’ve tried it. The sharp citrus flavours cut through the richness of the meat and creates a contrast that will leave your taste buds wanting more.

Curious carnivores should opt for the Tebasaki Gyoza - two pieces of chicken stuffed with gyoza meat. The chicken is crisp and flavourful, and when combined with the gyoza filling, this is a dish you’ll want to have seconds of. (Jul 2018)

"Chapter 55","Italian bistros are a dime a dozen, but rarely do you happen upon one boasting a large, well-executed menu with an equal number of classic dishes and inventive new recipes. Chapter 55 is a homely little spot with friendly service and delicious food that will transport you straight to the heart of Rome.

The Lobster Ravioli features homemade ravioli made with fresh lobster bathed in cream sauce and topped with a generous helping of parmesan cheese. The lobster meat is juicy and bursting with flavour that enhances the creaminess of the sauce, giving the dish a buttery smooth mouthfeel and an indescribably decadent taste. The Bonito Pizza is a fusion dish made with Tonkatsu sauce, bonito flakes and ham, which has a unique umami taste that gives the cheesy pizza base a new dimension of flavour.

While the main items are certainly tempting, the true highlight of the menu are the desserts. There is a variety of waffles with gelato on offer - from Salted Caramel to Butterscotch Banana. The Chapter 55 Gelato Waffle, however, is simple and perfectly delicious. Served with fresh fruits cooked in cinnamon sauce and Chantilly cream, this dish is the perfect way to end off an authentic Italian meal at this cosy bistro.

The Smoked Salmon Salad is an excellent option for diners who are watching their waistlines. Made with tender pieces of smoked salmon tossed in crunchy greens, this dish is best enjoyed with one of their classic cocktails or the ever-popular Frozen Margarita. Not a fan of alcohol? Fear not, as the mocktail options are just as numerous. We like the Shirley Temple for it’s citrus flavour sweetened by a hint of Grenadine syrup.

"Chimichanga","It doesn’t look like much: literally a dusty-looking, bare-walled “cantina” with some upcycled furniture and distressed-looking walls. But that’s the point. Styled as Singapore’s first “Mexican dive bar,” the fuss-free grunge is part of the concept, the vibe is something like a little shack somewhere in the Sonora Desert. The food, though, is anything but sparse. Here, there are tacos, burritos and Mexican rice bowls bursting with the spicy, punchy flavours of one of Singapore’s most popular new cuisines.
There’s the usual holy trinity of tacos, meat, and salsa, with fillings ranging from tender pork carnitas and crispy boracho fish to pulled beef singing with the smoky heat of ancho peppers. Top it up with some rice, beans, and extra salsa and have it wrapped up in a stretchy tortilla for some burrito goodness, or just have all of that in a bowl if you want to keep your fingers clean for when you reach for that bottle of Mexican beer. The eatery’s namesake is the sinful Chimichanga, essentially a burrito that, as if it weren’t indulgent enough, undergoes some deep frying for an insane amount of crunch. Extras here include spicy jalapeno poppers and buffalo wings for group situations where sharing platters are required because, and let’s face it, you’re not going to share that burrito. Wash it all down with heady tequila-based cocktails and you’re all set for the rest of that desert trek, throat a little less parched, tummy a lot less empty.

"The Chop House (VivoCity)","There are many things that should never be DIY - haircuts, electrical work, legal representation. However we do live in Singapore, where the do-it-yourself food culture has given us such tasty dining experiences as Korean BBQ, steamboat and even salad bars.
Thus, when we heard of the novel self-tap beer system at The Chop House, we were skeptical on which side of the DIY fence it would fall. Then we tried it, and we are now true believers that draught beer actually tastes better when served oneself, without a mind-numbing wait at a bar. The Chop House offers 6 brew varieties with taps sprinkled about their chic gastro bar space, so you are never more than a few steps away from a cold, refreshing mug.
The self-taps are evident of The Chop House's style - cool, casual and fun. In contrast to its sister restaurant Wooloomooloo Steakhouse in Raffles City, the kitchen puts an innovative spin on meaty classics at very reasonable price tags. Located at VivoCity, the indoor-outdoor locale masters the blend of bar and restaurant, with an open flow of picnic tables, industrial chic lighting and loft-sized windows letting the outside pour in.

"Chuan Hung","Chuan Hung’s name is beautifully straightforward belying the respect, thought and care that was put into it, much like its offerings. Chuan Hung or ‘Sichuan Alley’ focuses wholeheartedly on one particular Sichuan ingredient known as Mian Yang rice noodles. At Chuan Hung, these noodles are served the way they have always been for millennia: with a choice of different broths, and a variety of toppings such as braised beef and pig intestines.
Chuan Hung’s rice noodles are, admittedly, a little more distinctive: they are specially sourced from one particular artisan who lives in a village deep in Sichuan. Research for months into about 50 different Sichuan noodle shops led the Chuan Hung team to understand that only one particular shop sold the exact type and style of Mian Yang noodles that they wanted to present to Singaporeans – but it took close to a year and dozens of personal trips to the shop in sincere appeal before the owners finally softened and agreed to speak to them. It took even longer to research and try the different noodles the artisan made: every detail was examined, down to the gauge of the noodles in millimetres.The noodles now served in Chuan Hung are customised for the noodle house, and found nowhere else in Singapore or South East Asia. The noodles may be ordered with the clear or red soups as well as the uniquely Sichuan mix of red and clear. In addition, Chuan Hung also offers a third broth option: a deceptively clear soup that is piquantly infused with Sichuan vine pepper, and a dry-tossed version. Those with bigger appetites can feel free to order “add-ons” as extra toppings for the noodles, and a curated selection of small plates – archetypal Sichuan sides such as Fried Crispy Pig Intestines and Braised Eggplant – as accompaniment.
The interiors of Chuan Hung is deserving of attention from the diner as well. Located in a side alley just off the far busier main street in much the same way that noodle shops in China have been set up for years, Chuan Hung is a little haven of gently coloured wood, bamboo furnishings and warm lighting. The small space of half a dozen tables – bustling when full, and tranquil when quiet – is inspired by the aforementioned noodle shops though elevated with thoughtful design details to ensure comfort for the guest even at the busiest of times.

Of course, no meal is complete without dessert and the Molten Chocolate Lava Cake is not to be missed. These incredibly decadent individual chocolate cakes with oozing molten centres are the best way to end off a great meal. Citrus By The Pool is an ideal option for all kinds of celebrations and every meal in between. (Jan 2019)

"City Hot Pot Shabu Shabu","A view of the CBD. Quality meats. Interesting soup bases. City Hot Pot Shabu Shabu checks all of these boxes. Located on level 4 of One Raffles Place, this is the hot pot restaurant to go to after work when you’re craving for something comforting and soupy.

The soup bases here are extensive, from Herbal Chicken to Tomato and Korean Kimchi flavours. Most interesting is the fish soup with milk, a soup base not commonly found in many hotpot restaurants in town. Order this creamy rich broth and get plenty of seafood to swish in it, such as plump juicy scallops, fresh fish fillets and prawns, homemade prawn paste and clams.

If you’re a meat lover, City Hot Pot offers quality meats at great value. Tuck into beautifully marbled cuts like wagyu chuck eye roll and Angus short ribs, and savour the meats as the melt easily in your mouth.

"Claypots Full Circle","Years ago, two Singaporean university students in Melbourne walked into Claypots Full Circle, a charming family-owned eatery where they fell head over heels with the humble yet delicious fare. After on that fateful night, the two Singaporeans wooed the restaurant owner, convincing him to bring his exceptional seafood to Singapore.

Now located along the bustling Amoy Street, Claypots Full Circle astounds with its fresh seafood options done with a Mediterranean flair. Expect to see nothing but plates of whole fish, squid, mussels, oysters, and octopus so fresh it’s almost as if you caught it yourself. Kick off your meal with a platter of appetisers, from the Cantabrian Anchovies & Caramelised Onion Toast, to the trio of dips where tzatziki, hummus, and baba ganoush comes served with some warm flatbread.

Then it would be remiss to come to a restaurant without partaking in their specialty – food cooked in claypots. We love the Moroccan Claypot, which comes chock full of mussels, clams, fish, vegetables, and couscous. The Pan-seared Sea Bass Fillet is another heavenly delight, cooked to perfection so the fish is flaky and oh-so tender.

From a family-run restaurant in Melbourne to a welcoming eating joint on Amoy Street that the whole family will love, Claypots has come full circle and is now known for its tantalising  seafood dishes and lively vibes.

How else to describe the dizzyingly gorgeous lobby, fluttering with hushed, 5-star service? You’d never know this spot once harboured one of the city’s original bustling ports of call for maritime trade. Since 1933, ships would be warmly greeted with savoury local specialties dished out by floating hawkers. Honouring that charming bit of history, The Clifford Pier acts as a showstopping backdrop for all-day Southeast Asian nibbles.It’s hard to imagine the glittery shores of Marina Bay hosting anything other than the sleek luxuries it's known for, The Fullerton Bay Hotel being its crown jewel. As such, it’s a lovely thought that The Clifford Pier pays respects to the rich tradition of the Bay’s enterprising currents, showcasing the best that Old Singapore has to offer then and now. And The Clifford Pier isn’t paying tribute with just a local-tinted menu, but rather a fully educated selection including rich Laksa, Soup Kambing, The Pier's Lobster Roll, Heritage Bites and Wagyu Rendang.However the homey cuisine doesn’t collide with the frothy aesthetic of the cavernous dining room. As if plucked from the set of a Baz Luhrmann film, the lushly appointed space is swathed in nautical hues of mineral blues, sandy buffs and rich textures.

After dusk, this joint turns into a laidback hangout place where friends can gather to indulge in lively conversations over shared plates and drinks.

Perennial favourites include the heaping Our Big Raw Salad, which features a guilt-free indulgence of fresh and raw fruits and vegetables.

To make dining a family-friendly affair, the restaurant shies away from predictable kids’ menus. Instead, COMO Cuisine encourages young diners to expand their palates by choosing any dish that is served in a smaller portion.

Having opened its coors more than 20 years, this Indonesian behemoth dazzles with its unpretentious Indonesian fare. The interior is stripped back, with simple Indonesian artefacts dotting the walls while an adorable dancing fish mascot stands at the door ready to greet diners.

What makes Indonesian fare so unique is its heady spice blends or “bumbu” where an amalgamation of the different spices create gorgeous flavour profiles that linger with every bite. Some noteworthy dishes that epitomise this mouthwatering phenomenon include the Ikan Bakar, where the fish, smothered in 18 different spices and top-grilled to perfection, emerges exceptionally tender with a thick spice paste reminiscent of otak-otak atop, packing all the flavours and juices in. And with the restaurant named after their signature dish, you bet that the Cumi Bali - a springy char-grilled squid dish - has that melt-in-the-mouth factor that we just can’t get enough of. Be sure to order Sate Madura as well, an 8-inch-long chicken satay grilled with kecap manis and topped with fried shallots that has become a much-loved favourite.

Finally, have you really had Indonesian if you didn’t savour some stunning rendang? Cumi Bali hits the nail on the head with their Kambing Rendang and its sister dish, the Sapi Rendang, both of which are perennial favourites. End with a lovely Cendol for a sweet end to a delicious and satisfying meal that has kept diners coming back for over two decades.

This RWS stalwart is helmed by resident chef Benjamin Halat, who is joined every three months by international guest chefs from Michelin-starred restaurants overseas who create fine degustation menus together with him.

Chef Halat’s pedigreed background means he can hold his own, too. When not joined by visiting chefs, the German native consistently turns out bold, cutting-edge European dishes. Appetisers begin on a fun note, with a picnic basket of homemade German pretzels and obatzda, camembert cheese infused with cumin and paprika. These lead the way to equally creative mains, like a smoked fish tartare with pickled daikon that is the chef’s interpretation of a popular charcoal-grilled fish you’ll find in the beer gardens of Bavaria in springtime. The star of the show, though, Russishes Ei. Chef Halat, turns an organic farm egg into a light and fluffy souffle texture, placing it atop a bed of potato cream and champagne foam on the side, with a dollop of Beluga caviar. It’s a luxurious dish that is light as air yet tasty at the same time, and is what keeps you coming back to CURATE even when there isn’t a visiting chef in town.

Amp up your meat order with classic all-American side dishes made in-house daily such as the Brisket Beans (barbecue baked beans and smoked brisket), mouthwatering Cornbread, and of course,  Mac ‘N Cheese.

Timber furniture, carved wooden screens, red cloth aplenty, you half expect an epic fight to break out in Dian Xiao Er, with kungfu kicks and wine barrels flying around.

Except the only fight one can imagine here is over the famous Herbal Roasted Duck that has been the mainstay of the Dian Xiao Er menu for the last 12 years. The dark herbal gravy that the duck comes bathed in is made of 10 Chinese herbs that include codonopsis root, foxglove root, and licorice root. This gravy is said to have a calming effect while relieving mental stress and revitalizing energy. We were definitely very energized after eating this duck, not least because of its succulence and moistness. The duck skin itself is also crispy and adds a satisfying crunch to the dish. Paired with fragrant steamed rice, the flavours of this dish are strong, but not overpowering.

"Ding Dong","Located at Singapore’s trendy Amoy Street, Ding Dong brings a contemporary twist to Southeast Asian cuisine, and it all starts with the space. You think you know what to expect with Southeast Asian food, and as you approach Ding Dong’s heritage shophouse address in an old Singapore neighbourhood, nothing seems out of the ordinary. Then you walk in and are greeted by a heady pastiche of vintage posters from all around the region, set against bold geometric prints, pop-art colours, and an upbeat soundtrack. It’s Andy Warhol meets a busy Bangkok street, a vibe that pretty much announces Ding Dong’s intentions: take a little bit of nostalgia and heritage and give it a magical Willy Wonka makeover.

The food here takes Southeast Asian flavours, textures, and ingredients out of their rustic home-cooked origins and puts them on an elegant, upmarket plate. Some of the results seem downright unlikely – Stuffed you tiao with otah mousse & kafir lime mayonnaise, or a cut of Iberico pork collar char siew treatment and served with an unusual caramelized pineapple with pork crackling, but they make for a deeply satisfying marriage of flavours and textures. More familiar take on regional food include the Chendol mai, attap seeds with gula melaka ice-cream. Come re-discover the Southeast Asian flavours you know so well in a brand new shape and form, and grab a cocktail from the superb bar while you're at it.

"Don & Tori","Meat on rice is such a deceptively simple concept, but does anything else truly cut to the heart of Asian cuisine? Here at Don & Tori, Donburi, the classic Japanese take on meat and rice is the big highlight, and it’s served up in the kinds of digs you’d expect at a Tras street location: oozing cool and modern hip, with subtle traditional touches in the decor. Before the donburi, get a few of the signature maki, bursting with textural contrasts. Like the Crispy Salmon Skin Maki, featuring shatteringly crisp skin, crunchy pickles, and fragrant shisho leaf tucked between mouthfuls of tender rice. Also good is the Truffle Negima & Ebi Tempura Maki that combines all of our favourite things into a single hand-held treat: meaty amberjack, crunchy shrimp tempura, crunchy cucumbers, and fragrant truffle oil.

The main event is a series of Instagram-worthy and stomach-filling donburi. All the classics are here. Think Singapore’s favourite genre of donburi, the Chirashi Don, thick-cut sashimi slices lightly dressed in a wasabi soy sauce. A more luxe version of that comes in the form of the Hokkaido Don, which as the name promises comes topped with Hokkaido sea treasures like scallops, salmon roe, and chopped fatty tuna. For the queen of donburi, get the blissfully simple but mouth-watering Uni Don, featuring two kinds of Hokkaido sea urchin, red and sea-water, each one turning this bowl of rice into a transcendent experience. Away from seafood, there are meaty offerings like the Truffle Wagyu Foie Gras Don featuring Seared Joshu wagyu, foie gras and onsen egg with garlic chips and truffle oil for a hefty blast of luxury. Wind down with a little bowl of tart Yuzu Sorbet to calm down your palate and ease off that food coma, and plan your next trip back to guzzle down more of these delicious rice bowls! (Dec 2017)

The ambience of the restaurant’s new Dempsey location takes Don Quijote’s dining experience to the next level.

"Dookki Singapore (Clementi)","Dookki, which means '2 meals' in Korean, is a fun and delicious dining concept in Clementi Mall. The 'first meal' begins with the much-loved Korean dish “Topokki” cooked to one's preferred level of spiciness.  Diners can then continue to their 'second meal', the Kimchi fried rice, by adding rice, kimchi, sweet corn to the remaining Topokki sauce!

To ensure that customers get to enjoy the most authentic taste from Korea, Dookki Singapore offers 6 types of Topokki, all air-flown from Korea. Other Korean dishes include ‘Eomuk’ (Korean Fishcake), Kimnari (Korean Seaweed Roll) and QQ noodles. There are 6 types of sauces varying in different degrees of spiciness, including a non-spicy sweet sauce for those who don't enjoy spicy food. There is also a variety of fish cake air-flown from Korea, spicy and non-spicy chicken dishes, seafood, tempura, vegetables and a wide selection of Ramyeon for diners to indulge in.

"The Dragon Chamber","When you arrive looking for The Dragon Chamber, you will find yourself at the entrance of a Kopitiam where patrons are sipping beer and having a bowl of noodles—just an ordinary street food stall. “This must be the place,” you say to yourself. The hostess then gestures you toward the beer fridge as if to offer you a drink. But instead of pulling out a tasty cold brew, the fridge door opens up into a portal into another realm like something out of a real-life Alice in Wonderland. “This is where you must continue alone,” says the hostess, as the fridge door opens into a street alley that transports you into the braised underbelly of the “Long Tang” that is The Dragon Chamber. Things are not always as they appear.
Secretly located within a brightly coloured Kopitiam, The Dragon Chamber is a speakeasy-style restaurant and bar. What may look like a regular beer fridge in a kopitiam is actually a secret door that opens up into its own inner recesses. Reminiscent of Chinatown gambling dens and secret society hangouts, the walls of The Dragon Chamber are covered with artwork from local and regional artists such as Sabotage, Mister Tucks, and Riandy Karuniawan, referencing past and recent Chinese tradition from a globalist, counter-culture point of view.
The Dragon Chamber offers an unconventional menu serving “guerilla style” food, representing dishes that are not typical banquet style Chinese food. Among its own wild concoctions from The Dragon Chamber’s test kitchen, the underground restaurant also brings back age-old Chinese dishes that never caught on in mainstream restaurants, because of unconventional ingredients. Yet the flavours are immense. Contrasting lovable Chinese-American recipes, The Dragon Chamber pushes the diner’s comfort zone with adventurous dishes that may even shock diners with unusual Chinese techniques of nose-to-tail animal preparation. One such dish is the Dragon’s Claw. Touted as one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, it features a Crocodile Foot braised in Chinese herbs, served on a bed of greens and a literal ring of fire. Bearing a taste similarly close to chicken, the meat is tender and sweet. Its skin is painstakingly descaled with a torch, revealing a thick and rich layer of collagen that coats the succulent herb-marinated meat with a soft and sticky texture, adding a consistent mouthfeel to every bite. If crocodile foot and mammal innards might be too adventurous for some, we also offer more conventional favourites such as Firecracker Chicken and Wagyu Truffle Hor Fun.
Not a space for political correctness and mellow elevator music, the restaurant recommends not bringing any overtly conservative in-laws you might have. Make your way down to The Dragon Chamber, we dare you to enter the bowels of Chinese cuisine to discover your true gastronomic self.

"Drinks & Co Grill","The original Club Street bottle-shop concept has been a long-standing favourite amongst discerning night owls in Singapore, and here the people behind Drinks & Co have expanded down the street into a larger space. Also expanded is their food menu, with an extensive grill section. This is definitely a more dressed up version of the brand, perfect for dates and big groups, especially since the heaving portions here demand to be shared. Off the grill comes the Co Wagyu Burger, enrobed in melty cheese and served with freshly-baked buns for mouthfuls of perfection. Then there’s the Char Grilled Beef Skirt Steak, still smoking at the edges as it arrives served up with a zingy chimichurri sauce and fluffy fried potatoes.

If you’re looking for a more restrained booze and bites situation, the elegant tapas menu here is the right fit. Think delicate little Shrimp Beignets with a twee and old fashioned cocktail sauce, or Burrata Cheese & San Daniele Ham for a little hit of creamy, salty, gooey goodness to go with some bubbly. Then there’s the Fried Brava Potatoes with Chili Mayo & Ricotta Cheese for a carb bomb that’s actually worth it. Meanwhile, booze is available by the bottle at super friendly prices, a deal that’s increasingly hard to find in this city. (Jan 2018)

"Drinks & Co Kitchen","Drinks & Co, stalwarts of the Club Street scene, have powered into the original nightlife enclave: Holland Village. Riding on their celebrated bottle-shop plus bistro concept, the group has devised a more French brasserie approach for this Village outpost, with a menu devised by chef Adama Koita. Open with a classic Cold Cut Charcuterie Board, a playground of your favourite cured meats including pork rillettes, chorizo, and salami, served up with crunchy cornichons and artisanal bread. There’s also an Artisanal Cheese Platter to go with the bright, robust wines on offer from the shelves.

Mains here come in the form of smoky grilled meats. Think hearty steaks like the Grilled Ribeye served with a medley of seasonal vegetables and red wine jus, or the New Zealand Rack of Lamb served up with French ratatouille and a salad of puffed rice. Other mains take a more British gastropub turn, with a Classic Fish & Chips, featuring beer battered Sea Bass, and Bangers & Mash made with fatty Kurobuta Pork Toulouse Sausages, crowning the menu. Dessert is a classic Chocolate Lava Cake affair, though you should also get the Raspberry Dome, an elegant, tangy confection, and make a double-dessert night of it. After all, this place is all about sharing, and with vibes this good, you’ll definitely want to bring a friend or two along for the ride. (Jan 2018)

"The Drunken Poet","There aren’t a lot of Irish restaurants and bars in Singapore, but this spot looks to be bringing the often overlooked cuisine to the forefront of the local dining scene with their traditional dishes, inviting atmosphere, and affordable prices.

You can’t go wrong with the Irish Potato & Bacon Cakes. Made with freshly grated potatoes and bacon deep fried to perfection, this dish is the perfect bar snack to enjoy with a Guiness. For something a  little moreish, opt for the Guinness Pie, a delicious pastry dish that is made with beef brisket, celery, carrots, and potatoes. This meaty classic is made with all the elements of Irish cuisine - beer, potatoes, and carrots. Adventurous diners can try the Spicy Red Bull Wings - fiery chicken wings marinated in a chilli sauce with a hint of red bull.

Bar grub wouldn’t be complete without a meaty main, and the hot favourite at this bar is the Chef’s Pork Ribs. The generous portion of ribs are coated in a secret marinade that is tangy, spicy and coats the ribs entirely. The other signature dish, the Poet’s Burger, consists of a juicy homemade beef patty drizzled in a rich secret sauce, then topped with tomatoes, lettuce, and onions and sandwiched between two fluffy buns.

This is matched with fiery Thai-influenced salads like the Pomelo Pick Me Up, a salad of tender poached prawns tossed in a zingy sweet chili lime dressing, dressed with peanuts, and scattered with tart pomelo gems for a true party in the mouth.

Located just steps from the iconic Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, this eatery has a menu that could easily convert any carnivore. The restaurant’s motto, meatless does not mean tasteless, is echoed in many of the menu items, which are made with plant-based meat alternatives that are just as good, if not better than the original.

The Marmite Vegetarian Pork Ribs are a chef specialty, and made with soy and yeast extract. While it may not sound very appealing, the combination of rich soy meat and earthy Marmite makes for a delectable combination - perfect as a snack or as an accompaniment to some freshly steamed jasmine rice.

Another dish worth trying is the Vegetarian Peking Duck. The clever use of fresh yam fried to crisp perfection to make the “duck meat” and the delicious taste of the of the dish itself are enough to convince you that you’re chowing down on real meat.

Essentially a bottle-shop with a series of tables along heaving shelves of wines and spirits, this is a chic and popular place to grab a tipple and some bar bites along this bustling nightlife stretch. With a jovial crowd made up of regulars, it’s also a destination unto itself, not just a trusty pre-game! While you decide what bottle to pluck off the shelves, nibble on some sharing plates and tapas. Sharing portions of succulent Marinated New Zealand Lamb Chops, Mini Wagyu Burgers, and tender Marinated Australian Beef Tenderloin Slices will tick off the meat quotient for the table, while a zingy Fresh Tuna Tartare with Avocado & Ponzu is a lighter, more white-wine appropriate plate.

For some mean shared platters, choose from the kitchen’s list of pizzas, made to order, and featuring various fun ingredients over an artisanal aged pizza dough that will have you eating each slice to the very end. Popular flavours include the Samurai, featuring teriyaki chicken chunks, onion, and green chili for a devilishly spicy Asian-style pizza. Also good is the classic Italian Capricciosa, a medley of Mozzarella, mushrooms, pork sausage, black olives, and artichokes over a tangy tomato base. The grill menu here is unexpectedly big for such an unassuming space, churning out hearty burgers and grilled joints, including a particularly indulgent Roast Rack of New Zealand Lamb, a heaving monster of tender, smoky lamb served with a delicate ratatouille and loads of rich jus. Or, for something a little less fancy but just as satisfying, chow down on the Mexico Burger, a Wagyu patty that’s spruced up with fiery jalapenos, salsa, and melted cheese. Food may not be in the name of this bar and grill, but it’s certainly no afterthought! (Jan 2018)

"Elemen @ HarbourFront Centre","If might only be halfway through a meal at this chic restaurant that you realise everything you’re wolfing down is vegetarian, but the vegetarians at the other table are more than a little delighted to finally have a restaurant that doesn’t make the veggie option an afterthought. It’s on full throttle here, serving up vegetarian versions of popular cafe and bistro grub, as well as Asian favourites like sushi and double-boiled soups. There’s a distinct Japanese inspiration at work here, with a sophisticated zen energy, which carries through to the beautifully minimalist (and healthy!) plates. Think a salad of meaty oyster mushrooms doused in a savoury-sweet sauce, paired with an elegant soup of burdock roots and monk fruit for a balancing appetizer to kick start the meal.

Mains here heat up a little in the form of crusty pizzas, like the Traditional Pomodoro Pizza topped with a variety of tomatoes and melty cheese, as well as pasta, like a rich and savoury Salted Egg Pasta. Japanese cafe favourites are given a nod, such as in the Japanese Curry Noodles with Bean Curd Roll, a tangle of chewy udon noodles coated in sweet curry with meaty mushrooms and dumpling-like beancurd rolls. One of the popular favourites here is the Sizzling Quinoa Brown Rice, some of the healthiest grains on the planet given the hot-stone treatment, studded with nuts, vegetables, and other healthy things. Wind down with a signature Lemongrass Latte, and that unbeatable healthy glow that comes with an all-plant meal! (Jan 2018)

"Elemen @ Millenia Walk","Vegetarian food doesn’t have to be dull, or by contrast so unhealthily prepared that it ends up being bad for you. At Elemen, vegetarian food gets a refined, elegant treatment, merging Western and Asian styles to coax flavours out of greens, beans, and everything in between to deliver plates that are sophisticated, beautiful, and delicious.

Located in the calm and quiet Millenia Walk, this is as Zen a meal as you’re going to get. Relying on the natural umami flavour of ingredients like mushrooms, fermented products, nuts, and herbs, the kitchen turns out elegant starters like Maca Soup, made from Peruvian Ginseng that’s known to energise the body, and Spinach Salad with Sesame Dressing. Vegetarian sushi rolls, like delicate shitake mushroom and purple rice maki, with its complex flavours and textures, more than make up for the lack of fish. There’s even pasta here, like Aglio Olio served with a beautiful serving of lightly charred baked bamboo, as well as a Salted Egg Pasta, a mound of linguine strewn with basil, tomatoes, and coated in rich salted egg sauce. If you’re looking for a healthy spot of tea, there’s even vegetable-based drinks like Lemongrass Latte and soothing Lavender Tea, perfect for those afternoons when coffee feels like too much of an imposition. Come feast on these delicate plates that will nourish you and your soul.

"Element on Tras Street","Tucked comfortably in Amara Singapore, this hotel restaurant-bar dishes out comfort food in an elegant setting. Warm lighting and round wooden tables lend a sense of cosiness to the space, in line with the food served here.
Sink your teeth into the Crispy Chicken Burger, a tasty combination of juicy thigh meat, crisp lettuce and sweet tomatoes. Pepperoni fans will also fall in love with the Chorizo Pizza here. The thin, leopard-spotted crust provides a good crunch, but what elevates the usual pepperoni pizza combo is the addition of diced spiced sausage which adds a slight hint of heat.
Meat lovers, the Steak Frites is meant to satisfy all cravings. Imagine a generous slab of Black Angus ribeye, seared in its savoury jus, with crispy golden fries and a side salad. Save room for the creative desserts — the usually-pungent jackfruit is toned down with cream and fresh berries in a Cempedak Creme Brulee, the perfect way to enjoy this delicious but misunderstood fruit.

"EMPRESS","The Privé Group's first foray into Chinese cuisine, EMPRESS snags a prime spot in the Asian Civilisations Museum. Offering up waterfront dining, the restaurant boasts an excellent view of the Singapore River. A theme of mixing old and new flows throughout the restaurant and nicely echoes the design philosophy of the museum. It's contemporary interior and vibrant décor contrasts with the colonial facade, and diners will surely enjoy the juxtaposition of casual dining whilst nestled in the confines of a formal museum.
This trend continues with the menu. EMPRESS features dishes that are a mainstay of Cantonese cuisine but does so in a way that blends good ole' Cantonese flavours with more modern touches. Don't worry, you'll still be able to recognize items from dim sum to their signature roast meats. Speaking of which, the Triple Roast Platter, which showcases Spare Ribs, Char Siew, and Roast Pork, all of which are carefully cooked to retain that perfect level of juiciness, is a team favourite! EMPRESS also bucks convention with their Western-style salads and plated desserts including the decadent Sticky Date & Longan Pudding. On weekends and public holidays, EMPRESS also offers a sumptuous dim sum buffet which you can pair with champagne for an indulgent treat.
All in all, EMPRESS hopes to eradicate the notion that Cantonese cuisine can be a bit stuffy, and you'll no doubt agree once you experience the relaxed environment and accessible dishes.

The creations by Extra Virgin Pizza are famous for evoking all of your taste buds and with starters like Hot Wings and Cauliflower Romesco, it only makes sense that you come prepared to indulge.

From the Pepper Pig Pizza, a crowd-favourite for meat-lovers, to the Pistachio & Pumpkin, a pistachio pesto-based pizza topped with pumpkin, baby arugula, lemon vinaigrette and three cheeses - the endless unique options make this pizzeria stand out from the rest.

Pair any of the pizzas with their housemade sodas, beers (on tap or bottled), a cuppa of specialty coffee roasted by Papa Palheta or a glass of wine. (Nov 2018)

"Fat Cow","Once you enter through the driveway of Camden Medical Centre, you'll emerge into a sexy, jazz-infused space done up with marvellous, dark-wood interiors, and the rich aromas of whisky intermingled with beautifully-aged steaks. It's a vision of paradise, and Fat Cow delivers on that promise.
One of the most beloved restaurants in town, specialising in premium Wagyu served in delicate modern Japanese plates, meals here are satisfying and unforgettable. For starters, you're treated to some delicious palate-warmers and amuse bouches, like the Tai No Kuro-Toryufu, a carpaccio of gossamer sea bream in an umami dressing of shoyu, seasoned kelp, and black truffle. There's also the famous Onsen Tamago No Gyu ""Marrow"" Furai, an indulgent piece of bone marrow that's fried till crispy edged, but meltingly tender inside, paired with a gloriously wobbly onsen egg in light, citrus-enhanced dashi.
But all this is just a warm-up for the meaty mains, a selection of hand-picked Wagyu beef cuts from all over Japan. There's Tochigi Wagyu, and Saga Prefecture Wagyu, among other selections, each with their own unique ""terroirs"" and flavours, which the chefs will happily tell you all about. Once you've picked your beef, you can choose to have it prepared in a variety of ways: ""Shabu-Shabu"", ""Sukiyaki"", or ""Sumibiyaki"", simply grilled over binchō-tan charcoal.
Regulars know that lunchtime is the best time to hit up this place for some deluxe but wallet-friendly afternoon indulgence: the famous Fat Cow Wagyu Donburi, slices of charcoal-grilled Wagyu served with onsen egg and shredded leeks over pearlescent rice, is served, and boy does it live up to its glorious reputation.
Whether it's a snazzy lunch or a special-occasion dinner, Fat Cow serves some of the best contemporary Japanese plates in town.

"Fat Prince","Exotic flavours, imperial luxury, and a hipster vibe may not seem like they go together but trust us when we say Fat Prince encompasses it all. Situated on Peck Seah Street this Istanbul-inspired, Marrakech-influenced eatery is the latest and greatest from the folks behind Neon Pigeon.
Not sure what to expect exactly? Think upscale cafe meets authentic kebabery because the menu is a serious mash-up of both. Offering a variety of taco-sized kebabs perfect for mixing and matching, along with a notable spread of newly interpreted dishes like the Braised Beef Cheeks with Chermoula and Roasted Root Vegetables Pide, hot skillet dishes like the Merguez Sausage Menemen, and more - it’s safe to say Fat Prince is a much welcomed change from the mundane Middle Eastern eateries we’re more accustomed to!

"Flying Monkey","A new Indian tapas restaurant  and bar is all geared up to be the next culinary star at the heart of Kampong Glam. Flying Monkey will offer diners delectable dishes of contemporary pan-Indian cuisine served tapas style, as well as classic international cocktails with an Indian twist on flavours. As the only full-fledged kitchen and bar situated amidst the bustle of Bussorah Street, Flying Monkey is also one of the few restaurants in the vicinity to have bespoke cocktails available.

Their best-selling small plate dish is the Galouti Kebab ($14). The word 'Galouti' means to melt in one's mouth, and this dish truly lives up to its name.This was achieved by mincing the meat no less than 13 times, then marinating the meat with certain spices and unripe papaya.

Other tapas signature dishes include Tandoori Chicken ($10) marinated in yogurt and spices; Tulsi Cod ($15) or Cod Fillet marinated with basil creating a greenish hue charred in the Tandoor; Calamari 65 ($10), a spin on 'Chicken 65' that is relished in Indian cuisine and would complement their cocktails well; and crispy Truffle Naan ($14) served with paneer mousse and pear chutney.

Big Plate highlights include Quail Musallam ($26), which features a whole quail slow-cooked and served on Kashmiri Pulao, and Nalli Gosht ($26), which is a lamb shank cooked overnight and bathed in a creamy peanut-cashew curry served with garlic naan.
For dessert, diners can enjoy Jalebi ($10), a traditional crispy Indian Pretzel dipped in aromatic syrup. Freshly made from the kitchen, it  is served warm and topped off with a sprinkle of Pistachio.

"FOC Restaurant","Like a magician with a particular flair for showmanship, Spanish maestro Nandu Jubany of Michelin-starred Can Jubany fame, produces a gastronomical spectacular of sorts, cloaked by the industrial facades of Hong Kong Street.
With his lovely assistants Jordi Noguera of Foodbar Dada lineage, and Dario Nocentini plucked from the Catalunya bar, Jubany conducts quite a show of Spanish culinary arts. The restaurant has just the fitting look, with zany motifs reminiscent of Picasso, materialized as if from a dreamscape. Pepper grinder light fixtures and super-sized sculptures of familiar faces float above the dining space. A vintage motorcycle adorns the walls, and the food too has a quirky appearance that eclipses the unexpectedly classic flavours. Jubany introduces Catalan folk cuisine, and with a wave of the wand, adds brilliant Asian twists.
The black Mediterranean paella is filling yet nuanced in taste, and the patatas bravas and tomato bread both show a different side of the traditional tapas dishes. On the more Asian end of the spectrum, the Thai razor clams are delightfully piquant, while the roasted duck with orange zest dumplings show the chef's hubris in remaking local favourites. The varied menu even includes gluten-free options like the chocolate hamburger, a dessert indicative of the humourous approach FOC takes to dining.
From the bar, brilliantly innovative cocktails are not in short supply. The menu is a clear demonstration of Nocentini's flexing of his creative muscles, using such unique ingredients as Matcha powder, cornflakes vodka, and galangal rum (though not all in the same drink).
If the name of the restaurant sounds like the slip of the tongue could be a dangerous one, it’s not an unintentional coincidence. Meaning fire in Catalan, FOC certainly plays with fire both in its name, its daring dishes, and its unapologetically unconventional approach to nouveau dining.

"FOOK KIN","If the blaring Cantonese remixes, neon lights, and painted pigs on the walls didn’t give it away, this is not your typical Chinese restaurant. Established by radio veterans “The Muttons” in collaboration with the celebrated Old Airport Road Hawker stall Roast Paradise, this restaurant is the perfect place to go to satisfy your carnivorous cravings. Cantonese Roast Meat is the name of the game here, and diners looking for a delicious plate of meat to stick their forks in will not be disappointed!

Honeyed Char Siew with crisp edges is an excellent option for diners who are new to Cantonese Roast Meat. Cooked with a deliciously tantalising honey glaze atop a slab of tender pork meat, this dish is juicy, mildly sweet, and is best enjoyed warm. The Roasted Char Siew is another option that is perfect for seasoned connoisseurs. The meat is flame-grilled for maximum flavour, giving it a slick glaze and smoky flavour.

Not a fan of pork? The Fook Kin Tofu is a silken tofu dish topped with salmon roe and cooked with traditional spice and sauces. This dish is tender, flavourful, and best enjoyed with a bowl of steamed rice. For something a little crunchier, opt for the Golden Lotus Root Chips - thin slices of lotus root fried to crisp perfection.

"Forest 森","High ceilings and a lush rainforest-themed decor make dining at Forest a serene experience. It’s easy to settle in and relax while perusing a menu that offers modern Chinese food with a focus on wellness. Helmed by celebrity chef Sam Leong, his signature dishes include Milky Chicken Broth and Ah Sam Abalone Mee Sua. The former is a nourishing double-boiled broth with morel mushrooms and bamboo pith served in a young coconut, while the latter is a comforting bowl of thin vermicelli noodles with plump abalone and fresh Sri Lankan crab meat in a tasty chicken soup.

For diners who can handle the heat, try the Mapo Tofu and Crab Meat with Japanese Pearl Rice — a generous chunk of Sri Lankan crab claw is tossed in a searing hot wok together with a spicy Szechuan chilli sauce that will leave your tongue tingling from the first bite.

Desserts are by Chef Joe Leong (yes, Chef Sam’s son), who turns traditional Chinese desserts into creative sweet treats. Try the Textures of Black Sesame, a molten lava cake with a nutty sesame filling. Topped with black sesame crumble and a scoop of black sesame ice cream, this is a fun take on the typical black sesame paste dessert. A sweet ending to a satisfying meal.

"Forty Hands East Coast","One of Tiong Bahru’s earliest and coolest icons has finally made its foray into the East. Opened in 2010, 40 Hands popularised Third Wave coffee and is one of the first few cafes we flocked to for a good cuppa flat white.

This Eastie offshoot sits opposite a popular durian stall and on the same stretch of road as Chin Mee Chin Confectionery.  And while the Tiong Bahru outlet is interior chic, Forty Hands in the East is more old-world — the floors are decorated with vintage tiles and the counters are lined with tins of their house coffee. Marble tabletops and a bookshelf filled with books (about coffee, what else) complete this old-school vibe.

Coffee is serious business here — beans are roasted on-site at Common Man Coffee Roasters, and you order your nutty brew black, or with a dash of milk in the form of a flat white or piccolo. Food-wise, the East side outfit keeps popular classics like the Jamaican pork sandwich around, but there’s also new additions like the Har Cheong Gai Waffle. The crispy, juicy chicken is perfect fodder for the waffle base. Or if you love eggs to go with your morning coffee, the Chilli Scram features chilli-infused, creamy scrambled eggs with wild mushrooms and panko-crumbed tomatoes.

Think piping hot Australian yabbies, Singapore-style stingray, New Zealand mussels in a cocotte of white wine, baked Big Head Prawns with lashings of garlic, grilled lobsters from Maine, and Laksa studded with meaty crayfish. And that’s just the seafood. Move along the stations and treat yourself to meaty plates of Grilled Pork, tender Poached Chicken, smoky Satay Ayam Bakar, and an Italian-style Oxtail done à la Osso Bucco. Pork Knuckle is given a beery marinade and sits out, crispy-skinned and tender, waiting to be sliced into little morsels of pure pork goodness, while tender Tandoori Lamb Chops bring some aromatics to the table, undercutting all these rich flavours. And don’t worry, you can always back-track to something lighter: the classic Cold Seafood spread that features sweet snow crab, scallops, and other oceany treasures that serve as an indulgent palette cleanser for your next trip round the buffet. A buffet experience that lets you explore the world’s best offerings alongside some of Singapore’s own hard-to-beat classics, it’s the perfect weekend afternoon activity.

Generously marbled slivers of 20-month aged parma ham from renowned supplier, Pio Tosini, completes this elevated ‘ham-and-cheese’ combination.

Truffle lovers will love the Tartufo Pizza, which boasts a thin crispy crust topped with chunks of buffalo mozzarella and generous shavings of black truffle. You’ll be lured in by the earthy aroma of fresh truffles, but what really makes this pizza a flavour bomb is the rich and buttery fontina ‘snow’.

For a true taste of glamour, be sure to order the Pizza Oro Nero. This squid ink pizza comes laden with mussels, salted cod fish, calamari, and gleaming pearls of trout roe.

For a visual treat, try the Paccheri alla Vittorio. The tube-shaped pasta is prepared tableside with a housemade tomato sauce and fresh basil leaves, then showered generously with shavings of 20-month aged parmigiano.

The Kimchi Fried Rice is the perfect dish for diners who are going solo. Stir-fried rice with pickled cabbage, chicken, and various other vegetables, this dish is spicy, crunchy, and surprisingly healthy. Sipping on some Soju?

Mid-afternoon is when the yong tau foo disappears but their Asian-inspired tapas won’t leave you missing it too much. Bacon Bak Gua, Camembert Toast, Dali’s Pork Feet and more, their small plates combine both western and Asian flavours with gusto, certainly a far cry from the more humble morning fare. Order dishes to share, get lost in their extensive sake menu, and settle in for a meal amidst industrial chic settings.

From a tantalizing tapas menu to drinks that won’t burn a hole in your pocket, we wouldn’t be surprised if you ditched your regular watering hole for this gem.

The bar bites menu is a mix of Mexican and local cuisine. Think Chicken Satay, Questo Mixto, and Nachos.

The accompanying peanut sauce and acar make the grilled snack perfect with a cold beer. The Chicharron & Chorizo Mixto is a great option for diners who love meat. Made with buttery pork belly and chimichurri sauce for some spice, this is a great option for diners who prefer fiery flavours.

"Full of Luck Restaurant","Cantonese cuisine isn’t always synonymous with slightly over-the-top restaurants, slightly gaudy with one traditional embellishment too many. Here at modern-Cantonese restaurant, Full of Luck Restaurant, you’d be hard-pressed to imagine Cantonese food coming out of the kitchen. Beautiful, homely with earth tones, the space welcomes everyone with inventive Chinese family cuisine. The two-storey shophouse interiors have been designed to exude the familiarity of home with a twist. A mixture of vintage materials like rattan weave, terrazzo and teak wood have been juxtaposed with contemporary detailing and open space planning. The look makes perfect sense, given the menu’s lineup of progressive, contemporary Cantonese dishes and Chinese-inspired cocktails. It’s less Chinese restaurant than it is, well, a chill Cantonese cocktail bar.

The chef’s signature Honey Glazed Char Siew is a specialty here with melt-in-the-mouth pieces of Char Siew blowtorched over sugar to give a sweet crisp exterior. The crispy Pu-er Tea Smoked Chicken is flawlessly executed with the scent of tea gently infused into the tender slices of chicken. Other dishes include a selection of Dancing Rice (aka ‘pao fan’) – dancing fried rice crisps in sizzling hot fragrant broth filled with poached rice and fresh toppings. Other family favourites are the Braised Garoupa with Beancurd in claypot and the tender Herbal Emperor Chicken with Collagen. Don’t forget the Chinese take on the crispy French Confit Duck Leg, served Peking-duck style with rice-flour wraps and a sweet dip, or fatty Kurobuta Pork Belly marinated in fermented bean curd and fried till crispy. Indulgence comes in the form of the classic Beef Hor Fun with an aromatic truffled twist. Classic Cantonese food, shot-through with local zhi char flavours, is given a bold, contemporary twist. Come re-acquaint yourself with one of Singapore’s favourite cuisines!

"Gaig","Satisfy those niggling cravings for Spanish food when you dine at Gaig. Opened by Carles Gaig, whose family has owned the Barcelona restaurant Taberna d’en Gaig (renamed Restaurant Gaig in 1989) since 1869, you’re more or less guaranteed an authentic Catalan dining experience. With its delicious paellas, tapas plates, and other tasty dishes, even the most discerning patrons will find little to complain about.

Savour every bite of the spellbinding Jamón Ibérico de Bellota Joselito; this prized ham comes from the famous Iberian pig, and the reason why it is held in such high esteem quickly becomes apparent from the first mouthful. The Patatas Bravas is another one to try, bringing with it all the satisfaction that deep-fried food can inspire – comforting and very much a Spanish dish, try not to gorge it all down too quickly!

The paellas are also a tasty option; do have a go at the hearty Seafood Paella with Calamari, Shrimps and Urchin, and relish the generous helpings of seafood. The restaurant also does lovely meat dishes, and you’ll adore the Pig Trotter Catalan Style with Turnips, a decadent and oh-so-delicious main if there ever was one. Finally, top off your meal with an Orange Ice-cream Soufflé, which will wow you with a light, zesty flavour that’s ideal for this tropical climate. You’ll have a great meal and memorable dining experience at Gaig, that’s for sure! (Jul 2017)

With award-winning Head Chef Angus Chow at the helm, this casual spot serves up Japanese cuisine cooked using traditional European techniques with hints of local flavour thrown in for good measure. The result? Hearty dishes that reflect the best aspects of each cuisine.

The most popular menu item is undoubtedly the Charcoal Karaage, which consists of chicken encased in an intimidating black charcoal shell. Take a bite of this dish and relish the juicy flavours of chicken and garlic melting in your mouth. Adventurous diners can even venture a dip into the Tobiko and Curry Mayonnaise for a decadent, spicy kick.

For something just as unique but a little less intimidating, opt for the Truffled Hiyashi Somen, a light dish that incorporates billowy Japanese vermicelli into a hearty mix of  sakura ebi, and tobiko, all topped with a dash of truffle emulsion for an earthy touch. Diners even have the option of including uni and caviar in this exquisite offering to add more depth to the medley of flavours on the plate.

"The Glass Onion","Located on Bencoolen Street, The Glass Onion (named after a lesser-known song by The Beatles) is a bistro by day that morphs into a bar at night. With gun-metal hued walls and wire-frame light fixtures, this industrial-chic eating joint is one cool place you’d want to be seen at.

Then there’s the food, and boy is it delicious. The Glass Onion conjures plates of simple yet tasty dishes that will satisfy even the pickiest eaters. Start the meal with some tasty balls of perfection, otherwise known as the Corn Ball Fritters. Seafood lovers would also get a kick out of the Ikayaki, which showcases a fresh piece of squid seasoned in sake and soy sauce before being put on a grill. And if your love for salted egg has not waned, then order up the Salted Egg Yolk Chicken Burger, which comes paired with a generous serving of thick-cut fries.

Give The Glass Onion a try and you’d be surprised to find a culinary gem that will blow your socks off with its Asian-inspired Western grub, all at decent prices that won’t break the bank. (Dec 2017)

"Goku Japanese Restaurant","From the folks that brought you Hokkaido Manpei in Central Mall comes this dinner-only restaurant along the Mohammed Sultan stretch. This is one of only three restaurants in Singapore that offers motsunabe, a richer version of the beloved Japanese hotpot made with miso and offal. Another key ingredient in their dishes is  beef intestines, which is incorporated into several of their small plate offerings, as well as several main dishes. The soft innards are cooked in a broth to bring out their flavour and collagen, and is said to be perfect for women looking to improve their complexion.

Seafood lovers won’t be missing out either since Motsunabe will be dishing out creations like the Stir-Fried Squid with Salted Fish. This dish is a briny combination of tender fish meat and firm squid tentacles stir fried in a savoury sauce. Perfect with steamed rice or even on its own, this is one dish that showcases the best of the treasures of the sea. The Hakata-Style Sesame Mackerel is another delicious dish featuring soft fish flesh bathed in thick, earthy sesame sauce.

Known for its porridge buffet, Goldleaf has also launched their first-ever a la carte buffet featuring eight of the restaurant’s signature dishes that diners can enjoy in unlimited servings. Start dinner with a chilled portion of the Double Beancurd Platter, where century egg (imported from Taiwan) is sprinkled with pork floss, bonito flakes and a touch of soy. The contrast of smooth, cold beancurd with the piping hot Taiwanese porridge is a great way to whet the appetite! The Omelette with Chye Poh (salted preserved radish) is reminiscent of grandma’s cooking, where the golden, fluffy egg is filled with bits of salty, crunchy radish. Good to share are dishes like Steamed Pork Patty with Salted Fish, and the Braised Pork Belly with Preserved Vegetables.

"Good Luck Beerhouse","There’s no need for luck at the Good Luck Beerhouse, a boozy joint that’s consistently packed to the gills with diners thanks to its winning combination of craft beers and delicious dim sum bites. Tucked away in a conservation shophouse amongst the cool stores on Haji Lane, this bar is a laidback and unfussy place that chooses to focus on only the good stuff – the drinks. That’s why you’ll find over eight draft beers on tap, as well as over 50 bottled beers, ciders and other alcoholic beverages. With so much variety at hand, you’ll be spoiled for choice!

What’s more, we love how Good Luck Beerhouse is a firm supporter of locally-brewed beers, going so far as to reserve six out of eight taps for Singaporean brews, making it a great place to bring your out-of-town friends who want a hands-on introduction into our local beer scene. If you ask us, some of our favourite brews include the Moustache brewed by Garage Project which has hints of chocolate and spice in a dark ale. Then be sure to pair your suds with yummy morsels that range from the pillowy soft Char Siew Pau to the oh-so-satisfying Chicken Legs.

"Good Time Eat Drink","Located in the historic Katong Heritage district, this restaurant serves up delicious and authentic Peranakan delicacies made from natural ingredients. Many of the dishes consist of familiar flavours with a Straits Chinese twist. The menu was carefully curated by the owner-chefs who are both true blue Peranakans.

Seafood lovers are sure to appreciate the range of seafood dishes on offer here. The Oven-Baked Nonya Sambal Barramundi is a popular dish perfect for sharing. The tender flesh of the barramundi is flavoured with traditional Straits Chinese spices, giving it a fiery bite that is best enjoyed with a bowl of steamed rice. For something a little less fiery, the Sticky Shiok Sotong is a great option. Made with a generous portion of springy squid, tossed in a mix of chilli and sticky sauce, this dish is the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of soup, and can even be enjoyed on its own.

Looking for a unique take on a classic Singaporean dish? Look no further than the cheeky Chilli Full of Crab Tofu. The base of the dish is the beloved chilli crab, and beneath the tender whole swimmer crab is a large block of egg tofu that has soaked up the chilli broth.

Named after the word for “rice” in Japanese, Grand jetè izakaya really cuts to the heart of the Japanese love affair with this fluffy grain: the focus at this Japanese-run joint is the delicious rice bowl, put together by the people who also run and own Kacyo, the upmarket Japanese restaurant at Bukit Pasoh Road.
For seafood lovers, there’s a bountiful Barachirashi featuring sushi rice topped with chunks of tuna, salmon, swordfish, and ikura, matched only by a delicious Salmon Ikura Bowl generously topped with slices of tender fatty salmon and salty roe. Meatier affairs include the Stewed Miyazaki Pork Belly Bowl, think a rice-bowl equivalent of chashu ramen with chunks of fatty pork belly, stewed egg, and wakame seaweed atop rice. A beef equivalent, the Wagyu Yakiniku Rice Bowl, sees stewed beef and a crunchy green salad on rice. Tempura Rice Bowls and even a Japanese Curry Rice Bowls round up the menu here, a true testament to the delicious simplicity of the humble donburi.

"GRUB (Bishan Park)","Slinging good old-fashioned Western style - well, grub - with a thoughtful approach to local ingredients, it may surprise you to learn that GRUB's less about greasy fast food and more about gratifying fare.
The founders of GRUB set out to build a diner with inspired, responsible and delicious food. And though many restaurants start out with such good-hearted intentions - recalling sustainable sourcing, organic harvesting, and no artificial preserving - the results are often less satisfactory to both the palate and wallet. Based on the buzz generated by GRUB since opening, and its bubbling-over space located off the beaten path in Bishan Park however, GRUB has nailed it. The window-encased space lends an eco-friendly vibe to the otherwise urban-hip decor. The mingling of hungry diners with park goers on the al fresco patio is the vision of peace, love and good eats.
And quite tasty eats they are. The lion's share of the menu is dedicated to burgers of every sort - typical grub if there was one. Beef burgers are made from 100% grass-fed hormone-free beef, which is freshly ground in-house, a distinction you can taste in the moisture content and firmness of the patties. The juicy chicken burgers use antibiotic-free poultry as well. For vegetarians, the Portobello Burger subs the patty for a meaty mushroom cap topped with creamy crumbled feta, fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The combination is simplistic and satisfying.
Of the signature dishes, the Mentaiko Fries are a must-try, featuring crispy shoestring fries crowned with marinated roe of pollock, and sprinkled with confetti of nori seaweed for a umami textural play that's truly unique. Another play on trendy Japanese flavours of the moment is the Sakura Ebi Linguine with crispy fried Sakura Ebi, tiger prawns and a hint of mentaiko.

The founder, affectionately known as Gu Ma, has more than 3 decades of cooking experience selling her signature chicken rice and wanton noodles prior to the establishment of Gu Ma Jia. She takes great pride and joy in cooking for family, basking in the happiness of being able to eat as a complete, united family – forming the basis of which the restaurant was created for.

Gu Ma loves to share her delicious home-cooked food from Gu Ma’s private kitchen, mostly secret recipes which are served to customers to foster strong bonding among friends, families and colleagues. Gu Ma Jia’s ingredients and seafood used for cooking are handpicked by Gu Ma and her team from the wholesale market daily, ensuring that only the best ingredients are picked to guarantee freshness and taste.

The restaurant’s dedication and passion for creating delectable home-cooked dishes won them the Food Fest Top 10 Favourite Restaurants for 2 consecutive years in 2010 and 2013. Gu Ma Jia is where the family belongs – a great place for families to gather and strengthen family bonds through the joy of eating. Other than providing food that tastes like ‘Home’, the restaurant is also a strong symbol for love, peace and hope.

"Guccio Ristorante","Guccio, representing the surname – and hence, the origins of Chef Marco - will offer Executive Chef Marco Guccio’s culinary philosophy: an Italian fine dining cuisine journey, from a homemade, hearty cuisine to a global fine dining success.
While using top ingredients is not unique per se, Marco’s signature cooking style is: in his cuisine, the core ingredient becomes the main actor in the opera. Each dish has one ingredient at the center of the flavor experience. While the presentations are at times a contrast of colorful and complex textures, Marco’s dishes create a balance of supporting flavors, similar to how supporting artists dance in harmony, in the background of the leading act.
This philosophy is pushed to its boundaries at Guccio, with critics sometimes claiming that a blindfolded customer would always be able to recognize the chief ingredients in the dish she is eating. This style won chef Marco a Bib Gourmand from the prestigious Michelin Star Guide for
two years in a row, in 2016 and 2017.
Chef Marco welcomes you to his restaurant. Its décor is, once again, balanced and aims to be comfortable, while remaining in the background. At Guccio, customers will be at the center of the experience, with the colors and design elements to balance the surroundings. In the background of Marco’s main culinary signature style, Guccio will further differentiate itself by taking its diners onto a seasonal journey across the various regions of Italy, their fertile lands and their precious seas. At regular intervals, aligned with the four seasons of Europe, chef Marco will explore regional ingredients and recipes associated to each season, a unique opportunity to visit Italy even when 10,000 km away from it.
Marco’s creation will be paired by the best Italian wine labels available. As for the culinary ingredients, Guccio will not focus so much on education about new ingredients or unknown brands, but on outright enjoyment of the best that Italy has to offer.

"Guenpin Fugu & Snow Crab Restaurant","Perhaps more legend attends to the infamous puffer fish (‘fugu’ in Japanese) than any other edible marine creature: tales of venom, stings, and the brave chefs who train for years before they are allowed to prepare this fish for customers hungry for its rich, bouncy flesh, and bragging rights. Here at Guenpin Fugu Restaurant, a Singapore outpost of the popular Japanese franchise, puffer fish is the name of the game, and it is the crowning highlight of the menu here. Whether in thick, raw slices of sashimi or sushi, lightly battered and served fried, or served in meaty chunks ready for cooking in a flavourful dashi hotpot, just about any method of cooking and eating this delicate fish is available here. One popular option is to have the meaty fish brewed with a light porridge, the perfect premium comfort food. Even the skin, lightly parboiled, is served, sashimi-style, with a zesty ponzu sauce. The puffer fish shares star billing with other premium seafood here: fleshy snow crab claws are served cold, cooked tempura-style, grilled, or hot-pot style. This is a rare treat made readily available, so grab a booking now! (May 2017)

"Gunther's","Stepping into Gunther’s is like entering a different world. It is a world of opulence, yet with a certain earnest simplicity and elegance. The Art Nouveau-inspired decor, with its highly stylised flowing, curvilinear designs of fauna and floral motifs, is stunning but not overwhelming, gorgeous without being showy. While the restaurant boasts furniture pieces from luxury brands, the overall sense one gets is of warmth and welcome.
This sense of elegant simplicity is evident in the menu as well. Gunther’s fans will undoubtedly be familiar with signature dishes like the Cold Angel Hair Pasta that has earned the restaurant accolade after accolade since its opening. The Oscietra caviar is delicately scented with truffle, which marries the flavours of the dish together perfectly. The delectably crispy Suckling Pig with Kriek Beer Sauce is yet another favourite. While the dish itself is evocative of wedding dinners, come prepared to be amazed by the range of savoury flavours that is packed into Gunther’s rendition. Other carefully thought-out creations such as the Carpaccio of Wagyu Beef “Tartare” style are also delightful. The meat is served with crispy potato – a beautiful contrast against the marbled Wagyu beef. Likewise, the Floating Island of Champignon de Paris on Consommé of Poultry is a magical concoction with the rich taste of egg yolk and mushrooms in every mouthful.
Apart from signature desserts like the delicious Fine Apple Tart “à la dragées” with Havana rum raisin ice cream or the warm soufflé with daily flavours, Gunther’s whimsical dessert creations are worth a try. Choose from 350 labels of wine to end your meal on a high -- it will be a suitably simple and elegant way to toast to an equally exquisite gastronomic experience.

"Gustoso Ristorante Italiano","Located in the laidback Seletar Hills estate, this casual Italian eatery is the perfect place to kick back on the weekend with friends and family. With someone like decorated chef Peter Neo at the helm, diners can rest assured that they will be served the most authentic Italian classics.

Meat lovers are sure to enjoy the Grilled Iberico Pork, served with a generous side of gravy. The juicy cut of pork is grilled to tender perfection and seasoned with herbs to make for the perfect main dish. Drizzle the meat with the accompanying gravy, grab a forkful of vegetables for some crunch, and tuck in. Prefer poultry? The Roasted Chicken With Porcini Sauce comes with hearty sweet potato and is large enough to be shared. The chicken meat is tender and juicy, and the accompanying gravy gives the dish an extra touch of spicy earthiness.

For a sweet treat to end the meal, dig in to the Tortino Di Lava. This molten chocolate cake is what dreams are made of. From the rich chocolate that oozes out from the first cut to the velvety soft ice cream it is served with, this dish is a treat -in every sense of the word.

"割烹 旬水 Kappo Shunsui","This swish spot in the city is the ideal spot to enjoy kaiseki-style private dining in an intimate environment. With only 19 seats, this is the perfect place to enjoy seasonal Japanese cuisine without the distractions of a larger restaurant. The seats all surround the chef workstation, which means that diners can watch as their dishes are prepared right before their eyes.

Boasting a kitchen helmed by the former protege of the legendary Chef Hideki Ishikawa, this restaurant has a menu that changes daily based on the produce that is delivered to them directly from Japan. Some of the must-try dishes on the menu include the Charcoal Grilled Seasonal Seafood. The fresh seafood taste is complemented by the smoky flavour of the grill and brings out the buttery smoothness of fresh produce. Want something a little moreish? Dig in to their richly fragrant Claypot Rice. An earthy dish of rice, meat, and scallions, this dish is served warm and best enjoyed with a glass of Sake.

Diners who enjoy a tipple with their meals will appreciate the Sake list. There are over 100 labels to choose from, and there is even an option of having Head Chef Nobu recommend some pairings for his dishes. (Oct 2018)

"Hard Rock Cafe (Cuscaden)","This gem of a London export needs no real introduction. The international franchise brings its brand of hard-pumping rock music, hearty food, strong booze, and top-notch entertainment everywhere it goes. This Singapore outpost, established in 1990, has the added advantage of being somewhat of an institution amongst late-night revelers at the lively Cuscaden area, a mix of interesting characters, a diverse mix of folks from die-hard rockers to curious tourists, all seeking the restaurant-bar's hearty food, hard-rocking local bands, and the raunchy humour of its resident standup comics.
The memorabilia is what keeps the Hard Rock family united across the world, but put that aside for a second and consider the grub. Think American dive bar with a little upmarket touch: chicken tenders in a smoky glaze of hickory barbecue sauce and honey mustard, buffalo-style wings in a piquant dry rub served with the customary blue cheese and celery, and the franchise's famous fajitas filled with your choice of grilled meat, tangy pico de gallo, and melty cheese. For something heftier, there's also grilled steaks and a selection of meats from the smokehouse, think massive pork ribs and beef brisket in a tangy, hickory-spiked barbecue sauce. Good food, good times, and good music have always been part of the Hard Rock promise, and at this grand old dame of the late-night Orchard scene, the party never stops.

"Haru","Haru is the brainchild of two food-mad brothers who’ve turned the historic site of the Old Badminton Hall at Guillemard Road into a little shrine to the humble rice bowl. Working with Japanese and Korean culinary influences, they draw on some of the most beloved rice dishes of these cuisines to serve up some very modern and innovative plates. At lunchtime, this is a build-your-own rice bowl situation. Take your pick of multigrain rice, pearl rice, or soba, and pair it with your choice of Japanese or Korean style toppings like Bulgogi Ribeye, Salmon dressed with miso and sake, or Soy-Marinated Tofu with hearty vegetables.

At dinner, it becomes a much more elaborate affair. Chazuke, the famous Japanese tea-rice, becomes the order of the night. The signature here is their Lobster Chazuke, which features air-flown bamboo lobster that’s lightly poached in dashi and served in the half-shell atop rice with kombu, tobiko, bamboo shoots, spring onions, and nori. You savour some of the rice, and midway, pour a delicious Korean-style tea soup made with bonito, kelp, and oolong, that turns this into an ethereal meal. Other chazuke options include the Mangalica Pork Chashu, and the Smoked Chicken, featuring perfectly tender chunks of premium meat in a heavenly broth of tea, pickles, tempura crispies, and tender rice grains. Chazuke may have had humble origins, but here it is elevated into a trendy and luxurious dinner, and boy are we grateful!

The delicious waffles served up here have become something of a star in the recent years for its crisp on the outside yet fluffy on the inside goodness. Top the delicious treat with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream and a slight drizzle of salted caramel sauce and you get a decadent treat none can resist.

"Heavenly Duck 天王鸭","The executive chef at Heavenly Duck 天王鸭 was poached from Hong Kong by the owners, who found his food so delicious they had to bring it to Singapore. And lucky for us, because authentic Hong Kong fare is within our reach without an airfare. The name says it all: roasted duck, done in that inimitable Hong Kong way, all crispy-skin and juicy flesh redolent with a five-spice aroma, complex sweetness, and subtle smoky finish. If this all you have on your visit, that’d be understandable, but there’s a lot more where that came from. Think other Hong Kong delights like a Cantonese-style Braised Beef Brisket, an aromatic, melt-in-your-mouth serving of tender brisket in a punchy chu-hou sauce, and a comprehensive selection of springy egg noodles paired with all sorts of meats, from Soy Sauce Chicken to smoky Char Siew.

Another claim to fame here is their Dim Sum menu, an entire world of dumplings, steamed savoury cakes, and meaty treats. Think classics like Chicken Feet with Black Bean Sauce, Tobiko-studded Siew Mai, tender Prawn Dumplings, and Deep Fried Beancurd Rolls. For a more indulgent affair, opt for the crab dishes, whole crabs tossed Singapore-style in various rich sauces from Salted Egg to Black Pepper, though our money is on the Crab Bee Hoon, gossamer noodles served in a crab broth, each strand coated in delicious umami richness. Cantonese cuisine at its finest and most casual, come for the duck but stay for just about everything else on this flavour-packed menu. (Mar 2018)

Decked out in leather sofas and a towering wall of liquor, this eatery has successfully created an environment that feels more like a good friend’s hangout nook.

"HolyCrab","There’s an exquisite simplicity to the menu here, but be warned: if you cannot eat crab, just go somewhere else. Basically, you order a crab done in one of their six styles, and have them with some carbs. The carbs are amazing though: think heavenly, lard-and-seafood kissed, wok-breath infused Hokkien Mee, a fine Bee Hoon steeped in a rich clam broth, or the HolyCrab Fried Rice stirred up with flecks of crab meat. But all this is only accessory to the real deal: massive crabs cooked in rich sauces. The signature item is the Holy Crab, an angelic vision featuring a Crab cooked in a rich crab broth, with lots of vermicelli to soak up the goodness. Then there’s the Orgasmic Crab, with a little sin injected by way of a salted egg & curry leaf gravy that is the perfect foil for sweet bouncy crabmeat. For something with more unusual twist, there’s the Balsamic Crab, with the meaty crustaceans bathed in a pungent, sweet, and acidic sauce made with balsamic vinegar, fresh herbs, and spices. Then there’s the house version of Singapore’s national dish: Singapore Chili Crab, and there are five levels of spiciness you can choose from, one for each decade of our independence. If you’re feeling a little crabbed out, throw in some decorative Seasonal Vegetables, or better yet, carb out some more with an order of fried Mantou buns to soak up all that sauce with. Don’t tell your cardiologist. (Jun 2017)

"Home Of Seafood","From its humble beginnings at Yio Chu Kang in 2008 to its present day expansion to Joo Chiat, Home of Seafood has been winning numerous awards for their aromatic seafood. Recipients of ""Singapore's Favourite Food"" in 2013, and also voted the ""Best Pepper Crab in Singapore"", it's clear that diners love the restaurant's ability to serve that perfect pincer.
One taste of their famous signature Black Pepper Crab and you'll be in love too! Their use of a milder pepper gives just enough heat to allow the sweetness of the ocean-fresh Sri Lankan crab to really come through, and often means you'll be down two claws before you've even realised how much you've eaten!
These capable culinary captains of crustaceans are capable of more than just that though. At Home of Seafood, you have the option of having your crab steamed, buttered, chilled, cocktail-ed, claypot-ted, or spiced up with chilli. Our personal favourite of the lot? The Salted Egg Crab. Salty, sweet, savoury, and velvety smooth, their version of this increasingly popular dish has us wondering if the days of Chili Crab as the ambassador of Singaporean cuisine might indeed be limited.

"Hopscotch","Newly located at Gillman Barracks in 2018, Hopscotch was previously located at Red Dot Traffic Building. Since its inception in 2014, Hopscotch has stuck true to its mantra of embracing the Singapore culture.



Hopscotch features the most interesting and whimsical cocktails that outright spell Singaporean; a barbecue-themed menu with an emphasis on sharing plates; and most importantly; the lively and friendly community spirit in the kampongs of before. What Hopscotch aims to deliver is simple, good food, good drinks, good company and good times.

"The Horse's Mouth","The first time we stepped into The Horse's Mouth, we were, quite honestly, stopped mid-gallop. A warm, smoothly finished wood bar, Shoji-inspired light fixtures that dominate the ceiling, and eclectic touches like the bright colour displays, evoke images of autumn and summer. Lit brightly enough for you to appreciate the details, but still seductively dark enough to leave plenty to the imagination, The Horse's Mouth is ahead of the pack when it comes to setting the scene for a great night out.
If you're a hungry horse, then don't fret. The snack menu is feedbag full of tasty, with the nonkotsu (chicken softbone), tatami iwashi (dried sardine crackers), and eihire (stingray fins) the ideal bar food to take the edge off. Feeling like you could eat a horse? We don't recommend that, but you'll be happy to know that you can order from Uma Uma's selection of umami ramen for something more robust.
As for the thirsty ones, well, the menu looked all well and delicious, but when a joint tells you it's a cocktail bar, then we believe that drinks have to be bespoke. You might have some trouble remembering what exactly was in them after all is said and done, but that's the price you pay for delectable cocktails that run the gamut of sweet, sour, fruity, or just straight up strong. Let them know what you want, and there'll be no horsing around.
If you're wondering why, or how, a place can be this slick (or why we made so many bad puns), our advice is not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Round up your drinking buddies, saddle up, and ride on down to The Horse's Mouth. We know a champion when we see one.

"Hot Stones Steak & Seafood","This family favourite at Clarke Quay offers a fun communal dining experience with a smoking hot “pre-historic” twist. This restaurant does exactly what it says on the cover: using an ancient, stone-age cooking method, your food arrives raw on the table before gradually cooking on sizzling-hot serpentinite stones from the European Alps that store heat well and, apart from giving your food to a perfect, juicy sear, keeps them warm throughout the meal.
With a great view of the river outside, especially from the lofty second floor dining area, part of the charm is a friendly crowd, made up of families and customers who’ve been coming here since 1992. Can you blame them? The premium meats here are cooked to smoky, piping-hot perfection. Choose from beautifully marbled Kurobuta pork or high-grade Tajima Wagyu, both of which sing on the hot stones and soften to sweet, tender, melt-in-your-mouth chunks. If riverside dining is not complete without some seafood, they’ve got hefty slabs of fish steaks, from salmon to cod, as well as Boston lobsters! Come sizzle away on these volcanic stones and get in touch with your pre-historic side!

The ubiquitous barbecue options are present, from Dak-Gooi (marinated chicken) to Saeng Galbi Sal (top grade beef ribs) and Deungsim (prime rib eye), but leave the cooking to the carnivorous friends in the group – they’ll likely know how best to treat the succulent cuts of premium meat and it’s a win win situation because you do less work and get all the delicious tastes anyway! The a la carte menu is equally packed with classics like Soondoobuu Jjigae (soft tofu stew), Kimchi Pajeon (kimchi pancakes), and Deagu-Jeongol (spicy black cod hot pot) - ideal for those who aren’t too keen on smelling like barbecue.
Sure, the price may be steeper than what you’d normally expect from the other restaurants lining the streets, but you’re definitely getting better privacy, fancier digs, and the chance to chow down on savoury dishes that explode with traditional flavours, all carefully prepared by experienced Korean chefs.

"I am... (Haji Lane)","While traversing through the streets of Amsterdam, Muhamad Jamuri bin Busori fell deeply in love with the city. From its vibrant atmosphere and the beautiful bridges, to the Dutch’s bicycle-oriented lifestyle, he knew that there wouldn’t be anything quite like Amsterdam. Upon returning to sunny Singapore, his love affair led him to start a cafe in 2013 that would be all things Dutch.

Now, the I am… Cafe is serves up amazing cafe grub to a bustling crowd everyday. And in case you were wondering, yes, the name is inspired by Amsterdam’s iconic ‘I amsterdam’ sign. Must-trys include the Dutch-inspired Fries & Mayo, featuring crispy thick-cut fries with a generous helping of rich mayonnaise. If you’re here with a group of friends, go for the I am... Platter, an elaborate showcase of all their starters such as the half-shell mussels, soft-shell crabs, buffalo wings, and many more. The perfectly battered Fish ‘N’ Chips has also garnered considerable fame, so be sure to try it while you’re here. You probably would have seen photos of their homemade cakes on your instagram feed, such as the cafe’s popular Rainbow Cake that’s as delicious as it is insta-worthy. The cake has seven layers, representing the rainbow’s seven colours of course. Top it all off with alcohol-free concoctions like the Virgin Lychee Mojito and the Bushramint, and your day’s made!

With an extensive menu, you won’t find it hard to pick out your new favourite dishes. Some popular starters include the unbelievably creamy Crabmeat Zucchini Soup and the Poutine Fries, where a heap of golden brown fries are lovingly slathered with crispy bacon, onions, parmesan cheese, and a rich brown gravy. For heartier fare, be sure to check out the Tom Yam Seafood Linguine. This Asian-inspired dish is made from generous amounts of prawns, squid, clams, and garlic, and is served over a bed of noodles. And of course it wouldn’t be a kid-friendly place without a kid-centric menu with options such as Chicken & Mushroom Cream Linguine or the finger-licking Nuggets N’ Chips.

"IKKI Izakaya","IKKI is the little known Japanese incarnation of ""bottoms up"". The kanji or Chinese letters are extremely apt, literally translating it to ""one breath"". And at IKKI, lunch is like a battlefield, with the kitchen dishing out lunch set after lunch set, the staff seemingly holding their breath until the whole ordeal is over.
Transitioning to the lull afternoon, IKKI brings their own blend of artisanal coffee with waffles, Japanese style. Known as Mochi Mochi waffles or Mmoffles for short, these Japanese waffles are crispy on the outside and extremely chewy on the inside. The waffles can be paired with salty sweet mitarashi and red bean, or customers can opt for the savoury ham and cheese version.
Night at IKKI is a different affair altogether. The whole place slows down and the menu changes from lunch sets to Yakitori or barbecued skewers, and a plethora of Japanese tapas that allow customers to eat and drink at their leisure. And to keep the festivities going, IKKI features local bands playing from Tuesday to Friday.

"il Cielo","While our city does not lack for contemporary Italian restaurants, few come close to matching the exquisite dining experience one gets at il Cielo. Perched on the top floor of Hilton Singapore, the restaurant offers guests a bird's eye view of the teeming crowds on Orchard Road, a fitting tribute to its name that translates to 'the sky'. With its small 48-seater capacity and hyper-personalised service, this intimate restaurant is a perfect venue for a romantic evening or small dinner celebrations.

Partake in any of this award-winning restaurant's delectable offerings, such as the Pumpkin Charcoal Ravioli that comes with chickpeas cream, red onions, Modena balsamic, and black truffles. A must-have for any meat-lover, the Rack of Lamb is paired with a dab of sun-dried tomato tartar, and baby carrots for a slightly sweet finish. The Lobster Salad is also a refreshing option on a hot day, thanks to the addition of toscana roschetta, ice vegetables, bottarga, and mascarpone cream. Meanwhile, indecisive diners who want to sample a bit of everything should check out the degustation menus, available at both lunch and dinner service. (Jul 2017)

"Imperial Court","Be prepared to feast like a king at the Imperial Court. Conveniently located on the premises of The Grassroots' Club in Ang Mo Kio, it stands out above the rest with its excellent Chinese cooking. With a sprawling dining room, rich carpeting, and golden hues from the lights, this restaurant has successfully created a lush and palatial feel in its decor, so it’s easy to see why so many couples choose to hold their wedding banquets here.
Imperial Court is known for its warm service, and platters of food practically fly out the kitchen at breakneck speed. But don’t mistake speed for sloppiness as the chefs work to keep up the high standards regular patrons have come to expect. Noteworthy dishes include the nourishing Double-boiled Fish Maw with Chicken and Black Truffle Soup, and Braised Superior Shark’s Fin with Crab Meat in Clear Broth. For a savoury bite, opt for the Baked Coffee Pork Ribs, topped off with slivers of almonds for an additional crunch. Round out the meal with a veggie side dish, such as the popular Poached Seasonal Greens with Three Kinds of Eggs.
A local gem favoured by Ang Mo Kio residents, Imperial Court shines with its stellar cooking and warm service. Skip out on this eatery and you’ll only be doing yourself a disservice. (Aug 2017)

"In Piazza","This funky Italian restaurant presents traditional Italian fare in relaxed but hip digs overlooking a lovely green patch of the Stevens Road area. Priding itself on authentic fare, a smoky oven churns out pizzas to order, and these pies have attracted quite a following among in-the-know foodies in the neighbourhood. Choose from a comprehensive menu of practically every pizza flavour known to Man, from a piquant Puglia pie topped with anchovies, kalamata olives, artichokes, and mushrooms to the ubiquitous and controversial Hawaiian. If you’re a purist, stick to classic flavours like Cipolla e Pancetta, a red-sauce pie scattered with crispy pancetta, onions, and melty cheese.

There’s also pasta dishes that will help fix any Italian craving. Think well-made authentic pasta plates here, none of that watered-down business you tend to find in Italian joints around the city. The Bucatini All’Amatriciana is a heavenly plate of tubular spaghetti tossed in a spicy, porky sauce of tomatoes, cured Guanciale (pork cheek), and tangy pecorino cheese. The Carbonara is a close cousin, made with a cheese and egg sauce instead of tomato, and prepared exactly as it is in Rome, with lashings of spicy rendered lard, black pepper, and no cream whatsoever. Grilled steaks and fish round out the menu, though honestly we think the hefty pizza and pasta plates will keep even the greediest of diners happy. (Jan 2018)

In an interior done up to look like a warm dining room - parquet floors, Peranakan antiques, and cosy lighting - orders are brought to your table with little fanfare, confident in their authentic flavours and contemporary touches.
Fundamental Nyonya techniques, classic recipes, and fresh spices, pounded together using the tried-and-true pestle and mortar method, result in fragrant traditional offerings like Kueh Pie Tee (crisp pastry cups filled with shredded turnip, served with prawns, crabmeat, and homemade chili dip), Ngoh Hiang (homemade five-spiced pork meat roll wrapped in soy bean curd skin and deep fried), and Organic Ayam Buah Keluak (braised organic chicken with black nut and exotic spices).
That's not to say that Indocafe is stuck in the past though; little tweaks to suit modern tastes are a constant feature in their menu. Feast on dishes such as the Otah Klasik (steamed 'Chawanmushi' egg custard with fish fillet, seasoned with coconut milk, and a special blend of herb and spices) and Chendol Panna Cotta, both great examples of when past and present collide.
Once you're done tasting a slice of Singapore's heritage, don’t forget to trot over to their Arts & Cultural Central where a little coffee appreciation and afternoon performance might go a long way!

And Inspirit House is the place to go when you want some delicious food to go with your calming views of the serene waterfront. Offering unpretentious comfort food, take your pick between Western favourites and punchy Asian classics. Think bistro staples, like a meaty Pork Loin Steak served with a savoury sweet pear sauce, alongside hearty kopitiam fare like a the Grilled Satay Chicken, except here served up not with ketupat but a buttery mash and seasonal vegetables. You get the same cool contrasts between plates like the Salmon Fillet, a pan-crusted number served with sweet mango sauce, and the Nyonya Seabass, a baked bass in a tangy and spicy Nyonya-style gravy. Our money is on the Dry Mee Siam, a fiery and tart tangle of noodles, sprouts, and shrimp that we think is the perfect light lunch for the charming Punggol surroundings, or the Dry Laksa, a stir-fried version of the hearty coconut gravy noodles. Dessert is a toss-up between light Panna Cotta and rich Black Glutinous Rice, or Chendol and a simple serving of ice cream.

The warm, cosy space is lively and buzzing, constantly filled with the chatter of the many diners — it’s hard to just walk into iO expecting a seat — and staff bustling about with steaming plates of pasta.

It’s hard to resist starting the meal with bread, because the ones here are baked fresh in-house and speckled with delicious tomatoes or mushrooms. The Roman schiacciata, for instance, is a golden-brown flat bread with crispy edges, which you either enjoy plain or stuffed with earthy truffle. A must-order is the porchetta, rolled pork belly roasted until the skin is crackling with savoury juices and the meat is super tender. Pastas are the star for main courses — the baked lasagne, grandma style, is absolute comfort food. But the home-made tagliolini is a dish you’ll come back for, with the springy strands of pasta tossed with generous amounts of garlic, olive oil and chilli, and fresh, chopped prawns.

"Jag Wine","Sit back and relax at Jag Wine, where good food and drink come hand in hand to make for a winning combination. With its wood-finished walls and candlelit tables, this classy establishment is a good place to go for a corporate event, a romantic night out, or, well, a great meal.

Have a go at one of the tapas dishes – the Crispy Soft Shell Crab will prove highly addictive as you crunch on each tasty mouthful. The Steak Bites with Blue Cheese Sauce is another (rather decadent) option, where sirloin cubes are accompanied by fragrant helpings of blue cheese sauce for a mouthwatering, unforgettable dish. If you’re hankering for a hearty plate of pasta, you can’t go wrong with the Crab Meat Pasta, where angel hair is topped with chunks of flavourful crab meat, mixed bell peppers, and red onion – it might sound like a fairly basic combination, but it works.

Few meals are complete without a dessert to top everything off, so why not take a stab at the Molten Lava Cake with Ice Cream? Its nuanced, bittersweet taste will serve as the perfect denouement to your meal, and it’s a take on the popular dessert that’ll be as good as you’ve ever tasted. So head down to Jag Wine sometime soon for a good meal, a nice wine, and a great dining experience that’s hard to beat.

"Kabuke","This intimate Japanese gastrobar is tucked away on the second floor of a Telok Ayer shop house, overlooking the hip set drifting through the streets below. The interiors are stunning: a dramatic, over-the-top homage to the kabuki theatres referenced in the name. It’s not all style and no substance: there’s a stellar menu and wine list put together by its team of gastro-veterans, you’ll be sipping sake and chowing down on delicate Japanese treats all night long. Head Chef Rio Neo, formerly of Fat Cow, brings swish modern touches to classic Japanese cuisine. Consider the signature Kabuke Beef Bowls, each featuring a completely different approach. There’s the classic braised Gyudon featuring strips of beef cooked in a meaty broth, a Wagyu Suki Bowl that tops rice with high-grade beef given the barest simmer in dashi, and the Wagyu Bowl, starring super fatty grilled Wagyu. Make each bowl more indulgent with the addition of creamy Uni or Foie Gras.

While the rice bowls here take pride of place, there are other options, like shatteringly crisp Ebi Tempura Harumaki, prawn tempura wrapped in Vietnamese rice-paper together with honey mango and creamy goma dressing, and the Kabukini, Jamon ham layered with Swiss Cheese and Kewpie Mayo, sandwiched between slices of warm toasted Japanese Milk Bread. Apart from the food, the specially curated sake menu is one of the highlights, and a knowledgeable sake sommelier is on hand to offer sake pairings with your food, as well as a unique sake tasting flight featuring a selection of the bar’s favourite wines. This promises to be a memorable experience, filled with the rich umami flavours of Japanese food and crisp, complex sakes, a Japanese dining experience like none other. (Nov 2017)

"Kai Garden","As the saying goes, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" and Kai Garden at Marina Square Mall wisely heeds this advice. While the menu does serve a range of more modern items, the majority of the dishes feature traditional Cantonese flavours without introducing too many fancy tweaks. In fact, any change that executive chef and owner, Fung Chi Keung, makes is carefully chosen to enhance your dining experience.
Dishes manage to achieve full flavours without compromising the delicate tastes of ingredients, and presentations don't lack for fun or interest. The Garoupa in Lobster Soup will have your server bringing forth a whole garoupa - freshly sliced - to be cooked in an intensely orange lobster soup right at your table. The resulting broth is deep and chock full of tender fish. Their Peking Duck is a signature, understandably so given the deliciously crispy skin, and will be sliced and prepared at the table to be served with a selection of innovative wraps and sauces. Not to worry, their less exorbitant items are equally as amazing. Try their surprisingly succulent Sweet & Sour Pork on the Rocks which are served like colourful lollipops on a bed of ice.
With over 15 years and a previous position with Paradise Group, Chef Fung's expertise reaches from dim sum to excellent roasts, and Kai Garden is the perfect place to sample his creations.

"Kausmo","This new venture promotes thoughtful living by challenging food norms that bring about unnecessary food wastage. Derived from the word ""cosmos"" - a system of thought, Kausmo is the brainchild of co-founders Lisa Tang and Kuah Chew Shian.
The design of the 16-seater restaurant revolves around the concept of a ""blank canvas"", setting the stage for the transformation of aesthetically imperfect ingredients into delicious dishes. Every dish created at Kausmo incorporates thoughtfully sourced ingredients; seafood from small farming communities in the region, secondary cuts of meat which are often overlooked in favour of prime cuts, as well as forgotten native greens and florals. Combining European techniques with Asian influences, Lisa, who has worked at Pollen, Jaan, and Les Amis, demonstrates how lesser-loved ingredients are no less delicious than their popular counterparts.
Expect to be greeted with a sense of comfort too as parts of the menu draws inspiration from the team's cultural roots, such as Lisa's Teochew heritage. Each meal at Kausmo presents a thoughtful approach for guests to think about how they can all make more conscientious choices in their everyday lives and contribute to a more sustainable ecosystem, in Singapore and beyond. The restaurant even has a dedicated retail and feature space that showcases works by local businesses, artists and craftsmen with thoughtfulness as their focus.
Ultimately, Kausmo offers good food with a good cause, creating an authentic and warm space for conversations about thoughtful choices and conscientious living to happen around the dining table.

"Kinara (The East)","There's a reason why Kinara has been a mainstay of the Indian dining scene in Singapore for so long, and that reason is, without doubt, the reliably delicious food. The East Coast Road outlet features its signature, old-world decor with an intricately carved swing posted outside, and scents of succulent Indian dishes wafting from the inside!
Kinara means ""river bank"" in Punjabi, so the fare is appropriately a mix of North Indian classics and some South Indian seafood specialties, particularly from the Kerala region. Each dish is dizzingly complex in flavour profile - as Indian cuisine is famous for - but none are overdone or exorbitant in price. You will find your favourite staples like naan and butter chicken, but if there's one Indian restaurant where you should push your menu boundaries, it's at Kinara. Try the Jhinga Biryani, with plump tender prawns and al-dente spiced rice or the Lucknowi Burra Kebab, with tender morsels of lamb.

"Kinou","The brainchild of Chef and founder Benjamin Tilatti, Kinou is both an eclectic infusion of fond memories and robust flavours, as well as a heartfelt ode to Tilatti’s mother, who ignited his passion for cooking and whose nickname is honoured in the restaurant name.

No wonder that Kinou makes for the perfect place to share a meal with friends and place. The concept’s small plates designed for sharing, with ceviche and tartare (and cheeky puns) dominating the menu. Nonetheless, Tilatti’s rich travels informs his palette and and hints of delicious flavours from across the world reflect this. Savour the Salmon, Hiding in Puerto Rico for instance, featuring some salmon spruced up with a mouthwatering coconut leche de tigre alongside some passionfruit and lime zest; or enjoy the delicate Kinou Signature Beef Tartare, resounding proof that beef is perhaps best served raw.

Unabashed meat-lovers who prefer something heavier will find their wildest dreams fulfilled with the Vegan Nightmare Platter featuring stellar favourites such as the Wagyu Ribeye, Margaret duck breast, wagyu sausages, lamb Merguez sausage, Kinou’s Signature Burger, and a dash of salad to alleviate any slight tinge of remorse. For some smashing dessert, Nadya’s Some Sort of Chocolate Dessert, is a delish treat featuring a sweet-savoury combo of miso caramel, chocolate mousse and a shoyu glaze - a tantalising combination that’s best savoured first-hand. Wash it all down with Kinou’s wide selection of drinks ranging from classic to inventive cocktails which, of course, come complete with cheeky monikers such as The Last Minute and the Singamule, a nod to Singapore’s love for all things spicy given that it’s shaken with a substantial amount of chilli padi.

The space also includes an intimate event space and a members’ lounge complete with a bevy of premium wines, champagnes and whiskies, so make Kinou your go-to spot for all things fun and delicious.

"Kwee Zeen","There are few things we appreciate more than an awe-inspiring buffet - the counters loaded with ocean-fresh seafood, mouth-watering charcuterie, and of course, tantalising dessert, make for a dining experience that's hard to beat. A buffet that comes with a view, though, makes it all the better. Kwee Zeen's outdoor deck then, is exactly where we'd spend any (and every) Sunday afternoon. Sunday's Champagne brunch offers live seafood, a foie gras gallery, cheese, a tandoor oven, and of course, the piece de resistance, the one-two combo of a dessert trolley and chocolaterie. Paired with the breeze coming in off the South China Sea, a meal at Kwee Zeen is not only good for the belly, its soothing calm is good for the soul.
And if you're intimidated by the idea of a buffet, then fear not because Kwee Zeen also offers an equally impressive a la carte menu! So whether you're a bottomless pit or someone with a bird-like appetite, this casual-chic restaurant on Sentosa's definitely got the right Kwee Zeen for you.

The decor beyond its entrance is redolent of Paris – more specifically the relaxed bistro culture that’s so common to the French city – as diners sit shoulder to shoulder in a long, cosy stretch whilst wine and conversation flow freely.
The Plat du Jour is always their classic Steak Frites, slivers of succulent prime meat generously doused with a secret sauce that pairs perfectly with each melt-in-your-mouth bite. Accompanying those piping hot babies are a fresh green salad and a heaping pile of crispy, golden fries. Finished your first round and hungry for more? That’s when the servers offer you the second helping that’s been kept warm on burners.

Although dishes like Insalata di Rucola, Spaghetti alle Vongole, and Ossobuco alla Milanese may seem standard, La Braceria's food is anything but ordinary, thanks to their fresh ingredients and superior preparation.

The Jamon Iberico “De Bellota” on the Tapas Menu is a must-try. Featuring top-grade ham and tomatoes served on fluffy fresh bread, this dish is the perfect appetizer to start a delicious meal or to pair with one of the delicious wines on the list. The wine collection here is extensive and features tipples from wineries throughout Spain. The Lobster Paella is a rich main that is large enough to be shared. Served with a whole Boston Lobster, this Carnaroli rice dish is smooth and rich, without being too heavy on the palate.

The sweet treats on the menu do not disappoint either. The Catalan Creme Brulee isn’t your average creme brulee - fluffy foam cream served with a nutty cinnamon ice cream, this is the Spanish version of the beloved French classic, and we daresay it’s better than the original.

Whether it’s lunchtime tapas or late-night drinks, La Cala is the place to go for Catalonian nosh at wallet-friendly prices.

"La Forketta (Dempsey)","La Forketta's reputation precedes it for having one heck of a pizza selection, though that's not the only thing this Dempsey Hill trattoria is getting handsy with. The pasta, bread and even salami is made in house by the loving hands of La Forketta's master chefs.
Carefully recreating generations-old recipes takes hard work, just as it did back in the day. The task has not daunted the folks at La Forketta, however, who have been adapting Italian heritage recipes to modern dining trends for years. Simply prepared, honestly delicious dishes are their specialty, and diners seem to be able to taste the difference that hand-making makes, judging by the flurry of activity at their balmy Dempsey Hill dining room.
Floor to ceiling windows wrap the cathedral height space in organic light and greenery from the Dempsey surroundings. A mammoth wood-fired oven and surrounding open kitchen is central to the space, clearly proclaiming the restaurant's pizza forte. On-trend black iron railings outline the windows and interior roof, while the freshly-cut wood blocks stacked neatly for pizza baking add to the slightly industrial feel. An outdoor verandah has an even looser vibe, with raw wood tables that hearken the rustic dining you're about to enjoy.
Take your pick from the gorgeous bread basket, baked fresh of course. The Focaccia is especially tantalizing, crusted with garlic and parmesan. Of the pizzas, the Salame with house-made, tender spicy sausage is our pick, which mingles with the lighter, charred sourdough crust beautifully. Of course, you can't go wrong with any of the tried and true pies, perfectly portioned for one hungry or two peckish eaters. A lovely spread of fresh fish and meats, like the Filetto de Branzino and Linguine al Fruitte di Mare is also on offer.

This was in the heart of the 1925. The Mozzarella was traditionally made of buffalo milk, Gennaro introduced in his factory a combination of whole cow milk producing a “Fior di Latte”. This mozzarella was sold and distributed from its humble origins in Lettere throughout the Naples, spanning from the Salerno to the rocky cliffs of Roma.

​In 1961, Caseificio Factory changed hands, passing to Gennaro’s son, Vittorio. He kept the original name of the factory and increased production. The family-run cheese factory became well known within Italy for its handmade authentic buffalo Mozzarella and Fior di Latte and up today Vittorio’s son Francesco, continues the tradition from the creation, to the production, to the sales of Caseificio hand-crafted cheeses and as corporate Chef of Italian restaurant chain in Italy and Dubai.

If you find the name familiar, the local delight - Sambal Fish, was created in the kitchens of Lai Huat. In this signature dish, the pomfret is deep fried down to its bones while retaining the juicy tenderness of the meat and accompanied with homemade sambal belachan - it’s a true spicy match made in heaven.
Since 1951, Lai Huat has filled the bellies of generations with their array of zi-char classics - from the fragrant pot of Claypot Curry Fish Head, to the gourmet Fish Maw Soup which is concocted with 8 large chickens, Chinese ham, dried scallops, fresh crab meat and many other ingredients. Three generations down, Patrick Lim recreates these classics with love at the elegant Lai Huat Signatures on China Street. Round up your family members and friends and reunite with these well-loved classics in the heart of the city. (Oct 2015)

"The Landing Point","The Landing Point, the high fashioned tearoom at The Fullerton Bay Hotel, is dressed to impress not only for a daytime rendezvous or pot of Earl Grey, but also for a killer after work drink of the more potent variety. Frequented by well-heeled guests of the hotel and city-dwellers of particularly good taste, this meeting place has been grabbing attention for all the right reasons.With gilded floors, seductive lighting and plush custom furniture just begging to be lounged upon, The Landing Point is nothing short of the to-the-nines design you’d expect from The Fullerton Bay Hotel. An haute palette of plummy aubergine, earthen greens and metallic slates strike you as fit for a runway rather than a hotel bar. However, from tea parties and tipples to all-day bites, the space fits the occasion to a tea.Delicate cakes and sandwiches carry impressively bold flavours in the tea service. As the sun sets into the bay, you can wander to the outdoor terrace for a waterfront breeze that’s the perfect compliment to a glass of bubbly. Or else sit down to an admirable Wagyu Cheeseburger, thankfully served all day alongside a signature collection of Old Fashioneds. Whichever beverage you choose, The Landing Point has just the accompaniment in a most attractive of settings in The Fullerton Bay Hotel.

"The Landmark","The Landmark is the in-house restaurant at Village Hotel Bugis, and it serves up a mean, halal buffet of local and international favourites, all bursting with rich, piquant flavours from Southeast Asia and the Mediterranean. Kick off your buffet spread with some hot Soup Kambing, a spicy broth of mutton bones, or a piquant Harissa Soup from the Middle East. Then move along to hearty regional mains like Beef Stew, savoury Malaysian Fried Fish with Kerabu Mangga (shredded mango), or Indian Mutton. That’s just the tip of the iceberg at this spread, which also includes Indian classics like Chicken Masala and Thai dishes like Minced Chicken with Thai Basil. For a more conventional continental buffet experience, there are live carving stations for beef and lamb, as well as a chilled seafood selection where you can grab fresh prawns and Spanish mussels. The dessert selection is as expansive as the mains, running the gamut from sugary sweet Gulab Jamun to rich Malay Kuih.

"Lantern","Recognised as one of the best hotel bars in the world by CNNGO.com, Lantern is a stylish addition to the bar scene at the sophisticated Marina Bay waterfront area. With an unbeatable view of the resplendent Singapore skyline, it’s no surprise that Lantern attracts only the most stylish and trendiest people in Singapore.

Paying homage to its locale and setting, the custom–designed circular bar counter is shaped like a lantern with bronze metal fins and is where the magic happens. Skilled bartenders sling out a wide variety of cocktails, including the Peach Berry Sling, a modern take on the classic Singapore Sling. The smoky and intense 45–day aged Bourbon whisky adds a certain depth and complexity to the classic Manhattan cocktail.

The dining choices on the menu are equally refined. The Grilled Herb Marinated King Prawn with Lemon Vinaigrette Field Greens is perfectly executed – fresh king prawns are marinated with an assortment of herbs, and then grilled to a deep, sumptuous, sunset–orange colour. The Seared Black Cod Fillet with Clam Broth and Heirloom Tomatoes is an explosion of flavours and an epicurean’s delight.

"Lazy Lizard NEWest","The Lazy Lizard is a beloved institution amongst the residents of the Bukit Timah area, who flock to this charming little eatery for its comfort food and chill neighbourhood vibes. Throughout the day, you can expect hearty Western fare that’s best enjoyed in the alfresco area where you can people watch in peace. Think super indulgent plates like massive Quesadillas bursting with chicken or beef, each option slathered with a healthy dollop of sour cream and melty cheese before a delicious sizzling over the griddle for that perfect crispy-gooey consistency. Another hit of meat comes in the form of the Crispy Pork Belly, the fatty joint given a 6-hour braise before being crisped to achieve golden crackling, for yet another crispy-tender marvel.

Regulars here love chowing down on the signature Shredded Beef Sandwich, essentially a pulled-beef burger, featuring wonderfully tender braised beef cheek served between fluffy brioche buns with little more than some cheese, lettuce, and tomato for accompaniment. Pure beefy heaven. At night, the place shifts into pub mode, with sports and beers ringing in the good times. What better way to get into the action than with some classic pub grub like a Crispy Fish & Chips, or a plate of sticky BBQ Pork Ribs, best washed down with some frosty pints and the good vibes of a true neighbourhood institution.

"Le Binchotan","Step into the restaurant and you’re immediately greeted by a tastefully designed interior. Timber rods form a rib-like topography that adds to the intimacy of the space which seats only 38 diners, while the long bar that seats 20 guests conveys the idea that Le Binchotan is a place for busy city-goers to wind down and relax. We also love that even the cutlery is carefully thought out, with each plate individually created by Singaporean potter Mud Rock.

The intricate attention to detail, however, is most visibly expressed in the elevated dishes offered here. This casual yet chic tapas bar and restaurant presents an alluring marriage between French and Japanese fare, allowing diners to embrace the best of two worlds. At the heart of the creations here is the use of bincho-tan, or white charcoal, to smoke the meats and seafood. Temperatures can reach more than 1,000 degrees Celcius, thus bringing out the nuanced flavours of the quality ingredients used. The dishes here are meant to be shared, and some stellar small plates include the delicate Madai, featuring a smoked sea bream served with eggplant, radish, and sherry vinaigrette. Among the Large Plates, The Mangalica Pork Jowl, featuring a sous vide pork jowl infused with katsu curry, and smoked on the bincho-tan before finally being served with a side of Japanese kabocha pumpkin, as well as the Boston Lobster “Live”, served with fennel, butter, and orange, stand out the most.

Pair the dishes with a glass of wine, as recommended by Le Binchotan’s Head bartender Sugar Ray Ruban, to enhance your dining experience. For cocktail lovers, their house cocktails, such as The Gin, The Bowtie, and Sake My Cucumber, are exciting options as well.

So if you’re looking for an intimate and intriguing dining experience, Le Binchotan should definitely be at the top of your list!

"Le Bistrot Du Sommelier","Located along the historic Armenian Street, Le Bistrot Du Sommelier feels so French you half expect to find Marius and Cosette from Les Misérables sitting at the next table having a quiet tête-à-tête.
Indeed, the menu is filled with dishes that are as quintessentially French as the Eiffel Tower. The restaurant makes all its dishes daily, and aims to fill you up with traditional French food created with seasonal ingredients. A highlight not to be missed here is their beef menu - L’Ardoise de Boeuf - which offers an array of beef served in various styles that ring true to the French way of cooking. Classics include the Tartare de Boeuf (beef tenderloin tartare served with French fries) and Joue de Boeuf Braisée au Vin Rouge (red wine braised beef cheeks). Looking to share? The Côte de Boeuf Angus Rôtie Au Four sees oven roasted Angus prime beef ribs, served with shallots and garlic confit, makes for a perfect dish for two.

Whatever you do, do not miss the very popular Rillette Bar where you can savour homemade French charcuteries. The rillettes, pâtés, terrines, and sausages are all available in small servings, which means that you can go crazy as you try the whole range available, before washing everything down with a choice wine from the extremely impressive wine list.

Le Bon Funk brings ""fine casual"" to Singapore's food and beverage realm with its refreshing blend of exceptional boutique wines and elevated plates, all set in a convivial atmosphere. The name, Le Bon Funk, is a tongue-in-cheek jibe at the misconception that all natural wines taste funky (we think they are much more). It is an open invitation to not take oneself too seriously and to always be a 'glass half full' kind of person.

"Le Rida (Robertson Quay)","Le Rida is the place to be when you feel like sharing. The concept here is inspired by Middle-Eastern skewers, but the meats are grilled French-style.

Start the meal with a platter of light Middle Eastern dips, like hummus, labneh and motabal (roasted eggplant with sesame paste and lemon juice). The restaurant’s hot mezze are also worth ordering. Try the Rakakat Bel Jebneh, fried spring rolls stuffed with feta cheese, onion, parsley and pine nuts.

Meat lovers will be spoilt for choice at Le Rida. For seafood, freshly grilled prawns are drizzled with a tangy apple vinegar. The seabass is lovely — topped with plenty of garlic and ginger on a bed of golden saffron rice. The Lebanese Kofta Kebab is also another classic not to be missed!

If you’re craving the smoky flavours that can only come from a tandoor oven, get the Chicken Tikka or the Mutton Sheekh Kebab. Minced mutton is put on a stick with garlic, onion and ginger, and roasted in the tandoor for that nice, smoky flavour. End the meal on a sweet note with treats like Gulub Jamun or Baklava.

"Les Bouchons @ Ann Siang","A classic destination for the tradition of bistro style steaks and the ever important French fry, Les Bouchons is certain to become your next go-to steakhouse.

The look of Les Bouchons defies any whim of trendiness and sticks to the standards of bistro design: curvy backed chairs and white tablecloths simply dressed with the essential fork, steak knife, burgundy napkin, and wine glass, sit upon tiled floors both inside and out on the charming patio. The shophouse locale fits the look, transporting the restaurant to a simpler time and slowed down pace in small town France. And with the upcoming selection of to-die-for steaks and free flow fries, you'll be glad to feel the minutes slipping by at their leisure.

Start with the Os A Moelle, or beef bone marrow served with crisp toasts. The meaty butter-like spread is indulgently delicious, and an ideal primer to the protein heavy meal. The mains are simply stated, and all come with sides of salad and endless frites. The Grilled Sirloin Steak with Herbs is a particular star as is ""The Real Entrecote"" from Normandy, which is best to be shared among pairs. The steaks are clearly of premium quality and cooked to rosy pink perfection with a caramelised char on the outside. The accompanying fries are of medium thickness with fluffed centers and crisped coatings, ideal for dipping into the classic sauces of mustards, bernaise, mayonnaise and horseradish.

However, the steak haven is no one-trick pony. On the weekends, the talented kitchen pulls out all the stops with the Couscous Royal, a tempting platter of marinated and grilled lamb, chicken and Merguez sausage upon a flavored bed of couscous.

"Li Bai Cantonese Restaurant","Named after the famous Tang-dynasty poet, the ambience at this Sheraton Towers stalwart is a feat in and of itself. Think Jade table settings, bone chopsticks, and discreet waitstaff. The dining concept here harkens back to the days of grand Emperors in China, so you can expect fresh ingredients and premium nosh in an equally opulent setting. Located centrally, the menus here cater to a variety of diners, so whether you’re after a exquisite business lunch or a cosy dinner, veteran chef Chung Yiu Ming’s delicious creations have got you covered.
The executive lunch set is a big hit with office workers, as is the dim sum menu, which features an array of delicate nibbles crafted with premium ingredients. We especially love the Crystal Skin Dumpling, a tender creation bursting with colourful vegetables. Meals here begin with the classic Chinese delicacy, Shark’s Cartilage Soup. Rich, tender fish maw and Goji Berries are the crowning glory of this light soup, that makes for the perfect precursor to the carefully curated cuisine that follows.
Whether you’re a seasoned diner or completely new to Cantonese cuisine, if you’re after a taste of Hong Kong, this is the place for you. (Apr 2018)

"Li Xiang Lan Hotpot","Housed within a refurbished shophouse, it doesn’t get more authentic than this. This restaurant in the heart of Chinatown boasts all the trimmings of an excellent hotpot joint - reasonable prices, a variety of soup bases, and friendly service. However, the purveyors have one more attraction up their sleeve. This spot has perfected the art of infusing herbs into their soup bases to keep you cool while enjoying the meal.

Known as the Ice-Herb Tea Soup Enhancer, 72 herbs are frozen in ice and pressed into a bamboo tube which is then fitted over the top of the soup bases. This allows the heat from the hot pot to slowly melt the ice and cause the herbs to infuse into the soup base. The soup enhancer does indeed enhance the flavor of the dish, giving it an earthier, more pronounced taste that would otherwise not be possible.

Some of the toppings available to diners in order to create their own hotpot experience include premium wagyu beef, iberico pork, handmade shrimp cake, and sichuan noodles. There are also a variety of soup bases available, including tomato, laksa, and pork bone. The broths are freshly made on site to ensure the highest quality and best flavour in the hotpot. (Oct 2018)

"Lighthouse Bistro & Bar","Inspired by their illustrious maritime history, Lighthouse Bistro shines brightly in a little corner off Jellicoe Road. Since 2003, it has provided both members and non-members of the Singapore Maritime Officers’ Union with a place to socialise and unwind. If you want to enjoy fresh and tasty seafood in a good ambience, you won’t go wrong with Lighthouse Bistro.
If you’re in a big group, pay homage to the bistro’s past by having the Fishermen’s Board - a platter of tiger prawns, fresh blue mussels, crispy Atlantic dory, and garlicky, spicy batavia squid. Enjoy the Milk-Battered Calamari that is topped with copious amount of chicken floss and tangy lemon tartar sauce. For mains, the Fishermen’s Angel Hair is a great fusion noodle dish with a spicy sambal kick. If seafood is not your thing, fear not! Soaked in a special marinate for 24 hours, the Honey Charred Chicken emerges completely tender and succulent, definitely a crowd favourite for a reason. For a sweet finish, try Mary’s Butter Cake, which is a buttery vanilla cake topped with either chocolate or vanilla ice cream, cookie crumbles, and berries.
The team at Lighthouse Bistro is extremely dedicated and driven to create good memories for you. Since its founding, it has undergone three major revamps to provide a refreshing experience. By providing quality at affordable prices, it is of little wonder that many of the diners are repeat customers.

"The Lighthouse","The Lighthouse is known for its unobstructed views of the Marina Bay skyline, but has also gained a reputation for underrated Italian cuisine, casting its spotlight on simplistic rustic fare.
Taking post at the spot where an actual eighteenth century lighthouse once stood, guiding seafarers to the Singapore port, the restaurant now serves as a beacon for unpretentious, and under the radar Italian cuisine. Perched on the 8th floor of the landmark hotel, the vista is unparalleled and just as breathtaking as a sailor's first view of the shore. The decor of the outdoor patio and adjacent dining room is contrastingly understated against the glittering, glamourous skyline, because honestly, how can you compete with that?
The kitchen specializes in a concept called Cucina Costiera, with food and wine from the gastronomy-rich regions of Italy like Campania, Sardinia and Sicily. This signals ingredient-driven cooking that draws inspiration from the Italian landscape, while you take in Singapore's. The Tagliolini al limone features homemade nests of pasta with a dreamy Amalfi-style lemon sauce. The interplay of rich cream with tart lemon is complex yet light-handed, and pairs nicely with the spiced prawns that top it. The Risotto allo scoglio or Sea Rock Style Risotto features all the tasty crustaceans you can find upon an abundant sea shore, like langoustine, crab, mussels, and clams. This veritable netful is presented atop tomato and parsley stewed rice.
The Bistecca is another must-try, with grilled American rib-eye arriving on a hearty wood plank in a copper finishing pan. The tender meat is flavoured with mushrooms and a decadent truffle mustard sauce that's sure to please. For dessert, the Cannolo and cassata includes a crispy tube of pastry filled with luscious ricotta and chocolate chips. A shining light in the Singapore dining scene, The Lighthouse is anchored securely in good taste.

"Lime House Caribbean Restaurant & Bar","Here at Chope, we are willing to do a lot for great eats. But if satisfying our Caribbean cravings means taking a long haul flight to the western hemisphere, that's where we draw the line. Thankfully, all we need is a trip to Chinatown, where buzz-worthy Lime House Caribbean Restaurant & Bar is just the place to get our Caribbean eat, drink, and party on!

"Little Sheep Hot Pot","If hotpot’s your thing, Little Sheep Hotpot spot is sure to be right up your alley! Founded in the early 2000s in Inner Mongolia, this greenhorn shook up the hotpot scene in China with their innovative hotpot -- minus the dipping sauce. Their rich broth all but made up for the lack of condiments, and the recipe has stayed consistent for over eighteen years. What’s so special about the broth? The savoury soup base, made with seven special spices and mutton from Inner Mongolia, retains its signature flavour even after long hours of boiling.

The Four Mushroom Soup is one of their most popular broths. Earthy and not too spicy, this base choice adds richness to all the items added. Meat-lovers are sure to enjoy the array of dishes on offer for the hotpot. The Australia Sirloin Beef Cubes are rich and buttery, and absorb the spices of the soup, enhancing the meat’s flavour with a spicy kick. One of their most raved options for hotpot is the Lamb Roll, which consists of paper-thin slices of lamb rolled into small tubes. The meat cooks quickly and is thin enough to soak up all the broth’s flavours. The lamb cuts are available on their own or as a combination with beef slices. (Mar 2019)

"Lobby Lounge at The Westin Singapore","With the Marina Bay area getting prettier by the day, you’ll want to get a seat at this lobby cafe which offers some of the most gorgeous views of the waterfront on the island. It helps that the view is framed by the chic interior decor and heaving tiers of tea-time treats, all of this several floors above the ground at one of the “highest” hotel lobbies in the city. The Afternoon Tea here is an unrivalled selection of international flavours with a big seafood theme running through it. Tuck into an entire Lobster Thermidor, buttery-fleshed crustacean coated in an oozy crown of melty cheese, paired with freshly shucked briny oysters garnished with gourmet vinaigrettes. There’s also their famous Crab Salad Sandwiches, refreshingly crunchy with bursts of cold crab, a decadent Trio of Sashimi, and the flaky Torchon of Tuna, Lobster, and Mushroom.

And that’s just the savoury stuff. When the sweet tooth starts hankering, tuck into their selection of petits fours, including an elegant Pistachio Cherry Cheesecake, little “shooters” of Tiramisu, freshly baked Soft Chocolate Cranberry Cookies, and a fragrant Blueberry Lime-Scented Mango Tart. Needless to say all this is perfect paired with a pot of artisanal TWG tea, brewed to perfection, or a bracing cup of coffee.

There’s also fusion numbers, like a wok-fried Mee Goreng made with pasta instead of rice noodles. The chewy pasta is studded with egg, shrimp, and clams in a piquant tomato and chili sauce.

Stepping away from kopitiam territory is the 8-Hour Braised Beef Cheek Bowl, a pretty self-explanatory number, except words don’t do justice to the meltingly tender beef on rice, enhanced with a runny sous-vide egg, wild mushroom, crispy bacon, and lashings of beef jus. Return to Singapore street-side goodness with a bowl of another sort: a formidable Clay Pot Seafood Hor Fun. Flat rice noodles perfumed with wok-hei is tossed with fresh seafood in a savoury egg-drop sauce, still singing from the stove.

"Lokkee","Chinese cuisine goes on on a journey to the West and back with Lokkee, a witty homage to Hollywood's Chinese favourites; think chow mein and fortune cookies. A distant cousin to what we expect in Singapore, at Lokkee, Global Chinese Cuisine is reinterpreted and elevated through fresh, top quality ingredients and clean flavours.
The Awesome Flaming Pineapple Beef, once a gimmicky Chinatown classic, here contains tender Thai beef smothered in pineapple curry. Tender, sweet, and undeniably Instagrammable, it definitely lives up to the Awesome part of its name! If you want to keep the fires burning, continue with the Firecracker Chicken Nest, a popular Sichuan dish of fragrant diced chicken tossed with dried chili and cashew nuts. Lokkee isn't just cult classics done well though. There's an undeniable finesse and technique guiding each dish out of the kitchen, perhaps best seen in a deft application of molecular gastronomy; mango puree masquerading as egg yolks in the Chicken Nest.
The decor of the restaurant reflects the same fusion of cultures as the food. The walls are decorated with Chinese brush paintings of Star Wars AT-ATs while Shanghainese pop plays in the background. This is Chinese cuisine at the crossroads of culture, and it definitely took a right turn.

"Lolla","Drawing from its underground supper club roots, Lolla fits right in on Ann Siang Hill with a petite but confident concept featuring uncompromising ingredients transformed into renowned small plates.
If you think modern design, communal dining, artisan ingredients and small plates could be the description of any number of popular nouveau restaurants in Singapore, you'd be right. However, Lolla has proven itself to be the cream of the crop, as evidenced by the standard wait list for a reservation to sample their fare. Here's some insider intel: book for lunch, where you can request a seat at the coveted bar (which is saved for those few well-timed walk-ins come dusk) and avoid the feeding frenzy of dinner time service. Why is the zinc-plated bar the place to be? From here, you can watch the compact kitchen create the wondrous small plates that have earned Lolla international acclaim.
Such plates include the Sea Urchin Pudding, a deceivingly miniature vessel of deadly-rich egg yolk custard, blackened by squid ink and topped with tangerine-coloured morsels of urchin plucked straight from the ocean. The dish is at once thick and light, the depths of umami refreshed by a spritz of the sea. The Beef Tongue Escalopes are similarly brilliant, tenderized to banish any minerally gristle and which presents a unique meaty flavour spiked by pickled sides. The Scrambled Eggs with Bottarga is a high-end play on the smoked salmon breakfast staple, the feathery eggs punctuated by shavings of fish roe. All dishes benefit from a glass of bubbly, which is intentionally the bar's specialty. It's a fitting choice since the extraordinary dining experience at Lolla isn't exactly a steal, making it ideal for special occasions.
In the basement, a large, democratic table-for-all accommodates the majority of diners, a design choice that loosens up the mood. The concrete and bare bulb ascetic is softened by vintage touches like antique crystal vases posted alongside family-sized cans of artisan ingredients atop the bar.

"LongQing","Hands down one of the coolest hotpot places we’ve seen, LongQing’s concrete walls feature street-style murals – done in monochromatic colours, naturally – that complement the edgy metal and wood furnishings. You can get pre-selected sets for two to go with unusual appetisers like Marinated Beef and Omasum Tripe or Chilled Seaweed with Homemade Sauce, but for finickier folk, a la carte gives you a range of options that can’t be beat.
Choose Spicy Ma La, Tomato, or their Signature Clear Broth to begin and then plop in savoury bites such as Crispy Fish Head, Fresh Prawns, handmade pork and beef balls, and a generous handful of vegetables ranging from Garland Chrysanthemum to classics like Chinese Cabbage and Spinach. If you’re like us, however, the stars of the show will be the meat offerings. Lamb Shoulder, Prime Beef, Signature Chilli Beef Tenderloin, chicken; the array can almost seem endless.

"Loof","Singapore’s quintessential local rooftop bar,  Loof, opened its doors to happy revellers back in 2005.  Named in playful reference to the idiosyncrasies of  local speech and culture,  ‘loof’ is a play on the way Singaporeans pronounce ‘roof’. Awarded as Singapore's best rooftop bar, Loof serves up quality whimsy, fresh nostalgia and unbridled playfulness in an urban garden atop Odeon Towers in downtown CBD.

A  fervent supporter of the local creative community,  Loof is often home to a series of collaborations with budding artists.  A larger than life neon installation “风和日丽”  (a Chinese proverb used to describe a beautiful day) by  Singaporean artist, Dawn Ng, adorns  the  ‘looftop’.  The Mamashop, a modern-day take on the classic mom and pop shop, features a selection of nostalgic gems and locally-inspired knick-knacks to round up the distinctive Singaporean experience.

Enjoy carefully crafted Southeast Asian inspired cocktails that are familiar yet unique. Cocktails in the limelight include Kaya  Lumpur, a refreshing concoction of pineapple rum, kaya, citrus, soda, house bitters and fresh Thai basil influenced by traditional kaya toast sets prevalent in coffee shops. Another must-try cocktail is the Kopi Cat, This cocktail is an alcoholic spin on the Singaporean coffee staple and packs an extra punch with overproof rum, orange liqueur,  mocha, salted caramel foam. To round up the drinks, Loof has a wide variety of Asian spirits,  from Japanese whiskies and sake to Chalong  Bay White Rum.

The cuisine, aptly coined ‘Dude-Sin’  (Dude-Singaporean), is a modern Singaporean riff on typical bar grub done in a style that is anything but  ‘atas’. Divided into four categories: chip chip, sticks and balls, and buns, the menu features bar snacks full of local flavour from every Singaporean’s favourite Chilli Crab Dip to our bold take on the notorious Ramly Burger.

After all this time, Loof continues to offer the best view of the Raffles Hotel and her surrounding area, and remains one of the hippest and funkiest places to meet old friends and make new ones. There’s a palpable energy that permeates the bar, and sitting there, amidst the skyscraper, urban gardens, and buzzing crowd of locals, expatriates and tourists, you can’t help but be swept up in that pulse of the city night.

Fresh ingredients, innovative cooking techniques, and an unorthodox take on classic Italian cuisine make for a menu bursting with dishes you wouldn’t find at a typical Trattoria. When in doubt, you can’t go wrong with something that is housemade.Start with the Housemade Wagyu Bresaola- an air-dried cured beef bursting with flavour. The meat has more intense flavours due to the dry ageing process, and as a result, this dish is perfect paired with a glass of red wine from the bar. For something a little moreish, opt for the Gnocchi Formaggi - a four-cheese pasta dish topped with creamy sauce.

"Mad About Sucre","The enchanting décor at Mad About Sucre totally tickles our Frenchy. Alright, we stole that pun from a nail polish brand but it was much too apt to pass up! The French flair is immediately recognisable, from the dominating whites, classic panelling and subway tiles, to the chic pops of colour and striped furniture, and Mad About Sucre manages to inject whimsy in the form of hanging cake displays.
This overt show of pride is understandable. Famous for bespoke cakes that, ironically enough, go easy on the sugar, their immaculate creations - courtesy of pastry and chocolate expert Lena - meld French techniques with British designs, and are both gorgeous and scrumptious. For those who want to swap out the wait for a little instant gratification, front of house has plenty of sweet treats you can scarf down immediately.
Although it's easy to assume Mad About Sucre only churns out stunning desserts, their French expertise extends to meals as well. Chef Eric focuses on magicking up nutritious, flavoursome French classics the old-fashioned way, which means no artificial flavours or preservatives. Think Potato & Leek Soup, French Baked Mussels, Grilled Fresh Prawns, Duck Confit, Bouillabaisse, pastas, and more. It's an interesting juxtaposition; the hearty, provincial fare and sophisticated desserts, but Mad About Sucre makes it work by paying meticulous attention to detail, keeping everything as natural and authentic as possible, and producing excellent quality. J'adore! (Jun 2016)

Expect a range of classic British favourites, together with some delectable pastas.
Those who like a good ol’ serving of Fish & Chips will love the restaurant’s offerings – we’re especially fond of the Cod option, which is perfectly flaky and comes fried in an absolutely delicious batter. Other items to try include the Cheeky Git, a yummy dish of tender, braised beef cheeks served with French beans, mash, and an addictive onion gravy. This one is sure to satisfy, with its generous portions. You also can’t go wrong with the Bangers & Mash, another classic that hits all the right notes; think garlic and beef sausages served with mushy peas and fresh slaw on mash covered in aforementioned onion gravy. Those with a sweet tooth will adore the Fried Mars Bars with Ice Cream, an utterly decadent dessert that’ll prove as sinful as it is mouthwatering.

"Madame Fan","Stepping into Madame Fan is like stepping into a vintage Chinese postcard. Everything here screams 1950s Oriental elegance, and silk fans would definitely not be out of place. Helmed by famed restaurateur Alan Yau, this spot aims to present the best that Chinese cuisine has to offer, without any shortcuts.

The restaurant’s strict adherence to tradition can be seen in their menu items - delicious Chinese classics that are rarely recreated to such high standards. The Lobster Cantonese with Ginger, Spring Onion, and Wanton Noodles is a delicious dish of springy, tender lobster meat and sharp, flavourful ginger. The noodles are bouncy and served with roast pork which blends perfectly with the spicy sauce and seafood to create the perfect medley of flavour and firmness.

For something a little less hearty, the Double Boiled Four Treasure Soup is perfect. Made with soft sea cucumber, fresh fish maw, dried scallop and tender crab meat, this dish is soothing and perfect as a palate cleanser or for diners looking for a simple dish that offers a taste of home.

Even with modernity on their heels, Madame Fan stubbornly refuses to deviate from their time-tested techniques, and proof of the labour of love put into the food here is in the tasting. With an air of  old-school elegance and delicious dishes, this spot is set to become one of the stalwarts of the local Chinese dining scene.

Located in The NCO Club and an extension of famed restaurateur Alan Yau’s Cantonese restaurant Madame Fan, the 40-seater Madame Fan Bar features house-made spirit infusions, edible garnishes and familiar flavours with a bold, oriental twist.

The Chicken Tikka Masala is crowd favourite, and for good reason.

Both the Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab deservedly get their fair share of fandom from both locals and tourists alike. But while Majestic Bay Seafood does a wonderful rendition of both, what you should really be there for is Chef Yong Bing Ngen's award-winning, signature creation: the Kopi Crab. This dish is a reflection of Chef Yong's culinary philosophy that Chinese cooking is a great canvas for bold, artistic flourishes. Tossed with a sauce made from fruit jams and juices, and three varieties of coffee beans, the crab's flavours blend harmoniously, leaving you savouring every last morsel! Flambéed tableside, it's one of those dishes that you never knew was missing from your foodie bucket list until you've tried it.
If you're fishing around Gardens by the Bay for a light bite, Majestic Bay Seafood also fits the bill. Its tantalising dim sum, only available for lunch, is worth a visit on its own. Pick from local favourites like Steamed Custard Buns with Salted Egg Yolk, oozing with creamy goodness, or signatures like their Seared Chilli Crab Meat Buns.
Dining at Majestic Bay Seafood is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for our bellies. Indeed, if it weren't for the restaurant's impressive waterfront view of Marina Bay, and magnificent display of 3D textured artworks by Singapore-based artist Hong Zhu An, we'd be sorely tempted to pack a basket of that dim sum for a picnic among the lush greenery!

Margarita’s Dempsey Hill is one such culinary gem, sporting a rich history that dates all the way back to 1988, with a longevity can be credited to its authentic and succulent Mexican bites that don’t cost a pretty penny.

Explore a trove of Mexican grub with bright and fiery appetisers such as the Cheese Fondue that gets its kick from a dash of chiles and chorizos. Meanwhile, the Nachos La Especial is another evergreen favourite, made with a seasoned blend of black beans, chipotle cheese sauce, jalapenos, guacamole, sour cream, and pico de gallo.

And we can’t talk about the mains without salivating. There’s the drool-worthy Carnitas de Puerco, which features a fork-tender piece of pork slowly roasted in the oven and served with a zesty dollop of salsa verde on warm corn tortillas. And be sure to save room for the tantalising desserts which include the popular Mexican Fried Ice Cream or warm Churros.

"Marusaya","An authentic Japanese restaurant serving healthy dishes in the heart of Singapore? Count us in!
Dashi Master Marusaya takes great pride is offering a large selection of healthy, Dashi-based dishes. For the non-epicureans among us, natural Dashi (as opposed to chemically-composed additives) is a key seasoning developed from Katsuboshi (dried bonito) and ingredient in Japanese cooking.

For example, the Agemochi Nasu Annkake (Fried Rice Cakes with Mushroom Dashi Gravy) are deep-fried parcels of rice cakes which go perfectly with the thick, flavourful mushroom Dashi gravy, whilst the Japanese Wagyu Beef Dashi Shabu features melt-in-your-mouth slices of beef cooked in a delicately-flavoured Dashi bath.

Barflies are also sure to enjoy the range of wines, beers, and spirits on offer here.

For a sweet treat to end the meal, dig into some Gulab Jamun - a traditional North Indian sweet made with milk solids and drenched in a sweet syrup. After all that fiery curry, this dessert is the perfect way to quell the flames. The rich buttery sweetness of this dessert will leave you wanting more long after the last bite.

"Miryoku Bistro","Spanning hundreds of years, Japanese and Italian cuisines are often regarded as an artform in itself, requiring chefs to undergo thousands of hours in order to master the dishes.  However, the cheery Kallang-based Miryoku Bistro has pulled off an amazing feat, seamlessly combining the flavours of the two distinct cuisines into one sumptuous fusion-centred menu.

Tucked away in Stadium Walk, Miryoku thrills ravenous diners with its rich and savoury fare. Expect signature dishes with a unique twist such as the Chicken Katsu Fry, showcasing tender chicken thigh that has been fried to a golden-brown perfection and served with mesclun salad and potato wedges dipped in zesty lemon mayonnaise.

The cafe also goes above and beyond to ensure its diners leave happy. Celebrating a special occasion?

"Mischief","Overlooking the outdoor concourse of the Esplanade is this American-themed bar and restaurant oozing with rock & roll and attitude. It’s one of the most popular eateries around the arts centre so you’re liable on any night to be seen chowing down on American street food with the city’s arty set and happening youngsters having a swish pre-game before hitting the clubs. Whether it’s pre-theatre dinner and drinks, or a romantic waterfront date with the strains of live music coming in from the Esplanade concourse, this is one of the city’s coolest spots.

And the food is no afterthought either. Tuck into hearty American fare like Tex-Mex influenced pastas, including a Pulled Pork Fettuccine, and Southern-style dishes like the sticky BBQ Baby Back Ribs. For something more casual, grab a sandwich or taco. Think messy but delicious numbers like their Open Face Tacos, with your choice of chicken, pork, or beef, slathered with sriracha mayo, fresh greens, and jalapenos. Also good is the Roast Pork Banh Mi, the Vietnamese darling of American foodie circles, two crisp rice-flour baguettes stuffed with roast pork, pâte, and crunchy pickles. For a good ol’ American burger, nothing quite beats the Classic Wagyu Cheeseburger, all 150 grams of prime Wagyu patty, caramelized onions, bacon, sharp cheddar, and BBQ sauce. Grab a beer or cocktail to wash all that down, and soak in the funky vibes with the rest of the cool cats out on the town. (Mar 2018)

Under the deft hands of Fukuoka-native Chef Mitsuyasu Tatsuro, simple sushi ingredients are made to shine. The chef employs a “one fish, three ways” approach to his food, so diners can choose one fish from the daily menu and have it cooked three different ways. One notable standout is the Alaskan King Crab, cooked in styles that run the gamut from kaminabe, tempura, and sashimi to grilled & served with vinegar, simmered, or in chawanmushi. Other must-try menu items include the Soft-shell Crab Roll paired with a mildly spicy mayo. The Asari Clam Soup is another divine dish that doubles up as a refreshing palate cleanser. Then complement the fresh seafood offerings with any of the eatery’s numerous sake and shochu options, such as the Nama Sake, an unfiltered and unpasteurised sake that goes down smoothly with sushi.

"Morettino Italian Café & Bistro","Nestled snugly in a corner of 100AM mall in the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood, Morettino Italian Café & Bistro is a great spot to relax and recharge after shopping. Here, the service is friendly, the food is honest, and the coffee is strong. You can’t go wrong with good Italian cheeses, and you see this in simple fare like the Cornetto panini. It is a delight to tuck into - generous shavings of cooked ham and smoked scamorza cheese encased in buttery layers of baked croissant. The Casanova does its part to charm as well, combining cream cheese and a light brie with fresh greens and sun-kissed tomatoes for that burst of juiciness. No meal here is complete without a coffee from the espresso bar — a double will keep you fit for shopping, or get a foamy cappuccino if you’re looking to linger for a while.

"Morsels","Located in the lush greenery of Dempsey Hill, this restaurant has all the makings of a chilled out hangout spot away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The interior of this restaurant is almost as green as its exterior, with hanging plants, repurposed wooden furniture, and wood panelling reminiscent of a weatherboard cottage.

This restaurant has won many accolades throughout the years and has gained an experience for their excellent food, and it’s not difficult to see why. Chef-Owner Petrina Loh draws on her childhood for inspiration for her dishes, and has created sharing platters of fusion cuisine that feature the perfect balance of flavours.

Diners looking for a unique dish can try the Pork Jowl Char Siew Wonton Mee. Made with tender, locally sourced pork jowl, herbal soy sauce, pork and kimchi wontons, and a fiery jalapeño chilli sauce, this dish seamlessly incorporates the spice of Korean and Latin American cuisine into a dish that is uniquely Singaporean.

Looking for a unique treat to end your meal? Look no further than the Jackfruit Banana Cake. Made with chunks of fragrant jackfruit and sweet banana, and topped with Mugi miso meringue and drizzled with chocolate sauce, this dish is deliciously sweet without being cloying, and the perfect dessert to end an excellent meal.

Ultimately, while Chef Petrina's culinary pedigree is nothing to sniff at, with Le Cordon Bleu and a stint at HUSK in Nashville under her belt, it's really the intimate hospitality and innovative courses that will keep you coming back, time and time again, for more.

Chef Edward Esmero joins Chef Maria Sevillano in the kitchen and promises to bring a completely new perspective to the cuisine that has so quickly settled as one of our island's favourites.
There is still a strong focus on authentic, home-cooked style dishes, and the new revamped menu combines old favourites with new ones. Simple, classic favourites like the Pulpo de la Casa (grilled fresh octopus seasoned with pimenton, sea salt, and olive oil) or the Chuletillas de Cordero ($32), pan-fried cutlets of milk-fed lamb with a garlic white wine reduction, are exactly reminiscent of the local fare in the countryside regions of Spain. The team is also introducing a brunch menu that's only available on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays (till 3pm) that include a Spanish version of the classic ham and eggs! Considering the general quality of Spanish ham, that sounds amazing to us!

With simple, classic fare done as the Spanish do - as an accompaniment to long, lovely evenings filled with wine and laughter - My Little Tapas bar is sure to steal your heart.
Taking a more authentic approach to tapas than usual, per its sister restaurant My Little Spanish Place, this tapas bar is all about the bona fide, Iberian originals - an all-Spanish wine list, five types of jamones carved-to-order, Spanish cheeses and only the most fundamental of Spanish snacks. The interior features rough-hewn woody tones and modern touches like bare bulbs. Spanish flare is evident in vintage posters, bullfighter-red napkins and rope accents that recall a traditional torero. The wine list is concise and convincing, each entry boasting its high Robert Parker and (Spanish equivalent) GUIA Penin scores, so you know that your choice will be a great one.
The cuisine is so classic and restrained that you can taste each ingredient that went into the dish. Andalusian flatbread features caramelized onions, piquillo peppers and a rioja reduction over grilled bread. The gambas are seasoned with smoky paprika and garlic, creating slurry so tasty that we recommend digging down into the dish long after the prawns are gone. For dessert, try the Chocolate Tart served with a traditional meringue sorbet with flavours of cinnamon. In all, My Little Tapas Bar's disarmingly chic combination of modern decor, warm vibe and delicious food has it poised to become your little tapas bar.

"Nabe Seizan (Japan Food Town)","The soul of Japanese cooking is dashi: the light stock most commonly made from dried bonito and kelp that is rich with the delicious umami flavours of the ocean.

Nabe Seizan is the Singapore offshoot of his two Michelin starred Seizan in Tokyo, which specializes in Japanese fine dining.

With such a specialized menu, you can count on every component to be spectacular: perfectly cooked beads of rice, delicate but fragrant dashi, melt-in-your-mouth beef and, of course, stellar service.

"National Kitchen by Violet Oon (National Gallery)","Violet Oon's unabashed love for, and knowledge of, the Peranakan culinary delights and culture of Singapore has manifested into cookbooks, Violet Oon Singapore, and, more recently, National Kitchen at the National Gallery. Given that we've compared her to Julia Child previously, it's safe to say thatwe're fans.
Peranakans didn't shy away from colour and were known for their intricate or opulent decorations, and you'll definitely see hints of this philosophy in National Kitchen. Decadent dark panels and mirrored walls are lit up by elegant wall sconces whilst references to the Peranakan way of life are peppered throughout the space. Rattan ceiling fans, distinctive tiles, and typical Singaporean foliage like palm leaves and orchids are just a few of the touches that make National Kitchen special.
The food is an excellent introduction into some of the more famous Peranakan dishes like Sambal Timun Nanas (pineapple and cucumber with chillies, onions and lightly sweet rice vinegar), Kiam Chye Ark Thng (soup of duck with salted mustard greens and a hint of spice chillies), and Buah Keluak Ayam (a stew of tangy chicken and the traditional buah keluak nuts). National Kitchen has also opened its menu's borders a little, offering other cultural favourites like Eurasian Beef Brisket Semor and Hakka Abacus Beads.
Be warned though, while some of the dishes may be familiar and well-loved, the Peranakan options often prove to be divisive.

And when we tried the Chicken Liver Mousse with yuzu kosho marmalade, our eyes lit up at how the citrus flavour uplifts the creamy mouse. In addition to delivering inspiration, Neon Pigeon also satisfies in terms of quality. Their smoked baby back ribs are tender and the barbecue sauce delivers a sake-infused punch.

Their artistic cocktails are just the thing to go with these little plates of pleasure. Try their house signature ‘Throw a Kyuri-ken’ which is a refreshing mix of vodka with cucumber tossed in, or bubble happily along with the Kyoho Fizz, where the base is a delicious Campo de Encanto, mixed with old world grapes and Calpis.

"New Fut Kai Vegetarian 新佛界素食","Don’t mistake vegetarian for boring. At New Fut Kai Vegetarian Restaurant, the dishes work thanks to the kitchen’s ingenuity. No meat allowed, but the substitutes that come out in its place are worth digging into.

The Nasi Lemak, for instance, shows off how the cook can get creative. The usual small fish used for ikan billis is replaced with deep-fried seaweed. The crispy slivers are crunchy and tasty, chock-full of the same umami you’ll get from the small fried fish.

One thing New Fut Kai really nails? The mock meats. So good, you can nearly forget it isn’t the real thing. Try the Braised Duck with Honey Sauce, or Deep-Fried Cereal Prawns. The sweet honey sauce goes well with the tender ‘duck’ meat, and the juicy ‘prawns’ have that delicious element of crunch. Not a fan of mock meat? Purists will enjoy dishes like the Gong Bao Monkey Head Mushroom. The tender slivers of mushroom are cooked with green capsicum, cashew nuts and dried red chillies that really pack in the heat.

"Nickeldime Novena","If eateries were people, Nickeldime would be your supercool friend who knows the ins and outs of food and art without being pretentious about it. That’s why you’d find yuppies and large families alike teeming to this graffiti-sprayed gastropub for its unfussy and approachable food and pints of ice-cold beer.

At this trendy bar, chefs have taken the classic bar menu and injected it with a touch of modernity. The result is interesting and exciting flavours that will have your tastebuds raring to go. We love nothing more than good bread and it doesn’t come any better than the Freshly Baked Sourdough, which only requires a pat of whipped French butter and smoked salt. Or how about N.D. Mac & Cheese? Made with IPA Cheese, caramelised onions, and crispy shallots, this new take on this American classic will undoubtedly put a smile on your face. And don’t pass on the popular Confit Duck Waffle. This pretty plate serves up a side of duck atop a cheddar and thyme waffle, and is accompanied by candied bacon and a fried egg. Then wash it all down with any of the astonishingly tasty nineteen craft beers on tap.

"Niku Katsumata","Welcome to the wonderful world of Japanese beef: meat that’s succulent, sweet, well-marbled, and unbelievably tender. Niku Katsumata prides itself on serving some of the finest beef produced in Japan, plated in the simplest ways to highlight the natural flavours of the meat, and paired with various complementary dishes to create a full, beef-centric meal. At its barest level, the beef here is of such high quality that it’s served up as as sashimi. For cooked beef, one of the specialities here is Tataki Wagyu, a premium A4 Grade Wagyu that’s lightly seared before being placed atop a bowl of rice and given the ‘chasuke’ treatment: a light, savoury bonito stock is poured over the dish, which gently coaxes even more flavour from the beef. You have the option to top this up with premium, umami-rich ingredients like caviar, foie gras, or ikura. You can also have the beef in the form of a magnificent set meal, the A4 Wagyu Beef Set, which features Japanese Pork Prosciutto, a selection of home-made pickles, a premium selection of  A4 Wagyu Beef, and a Japanese A4 Beef Curry Rice. The beef here, beautifully marbled, tender, and served very rare, is prepared by chef Tsuyoshi Katsumata in the most unusual of ways: it’s cooked over a crystal plate, a method that apparently evenly distributes the heat and cooks the meat gently, ensuring it remains perfectly juicy. The incredible flavour of the beef at Niku Katsumata has to be tasted to be believed. A word of warning: you may never go back to your supermarket varieties after this!

"No Signboard Seafood (Esplanade Mall)","Indulge your seafood cravings and pay a visit to No Signboard Seafood, the popular chain famous for its White Pepper Crab and other seafood dishes. Part of what makes this particular establishment extra interesting is the story of its humble beginnings, because who doesn’t love a good origin or success story? With a history dating back to the late 1970s, No Signboard Seafood began as a hawker centre seafood stall with literally no signboard and sales of three crabs a day. And look at it now – with outlets in several different locations, the establishment’s story makes for a narrative that’s about as satisfying as the food it serves.All this wouldn’t be possible without some real quality cooking, of course – Singaporeans are a discerning lot when it comes to their food, and a chain that has stood the test of time the way No Signboard Seafood should more or less be worth its salt. Sink your teeth into a delightfully fresh, sweet hunk of crab meat when you order a crab dish (again we’re plugging the White Pepper Crab), and you’ll understand why this is an eatery that has endured for so long. Don’t forget to try the irresistibly spicy Sambal Kang Kong, another popular must-try option. Other seafood items are definitely worth a taste too. Unpretentious and reliable, delicious and satisfying, No Signboard Seafood is definitely a place that hits all the right notes, and then some.

"NOX - Dine in the Dark","This social experiment-meets-unique dining experience has enthralled diners with its fascinating concept: led into a restaurant that’s completely shrouded in darkness, with only a blind guide to assist you; sight, one of the key elements of taste, is removed. What remains is for you to enjoy the mystery of what’s on your plate, and discover a new element of taste: surprise. All the while, your blind guide helps you navigate the table and your plate, in a reversal of roles that will leave you with something to ponder beyond a delicious meal.

The food here is no afterthought, either, and features a French palette courtesy of veteran Chef, Desmond Lee. The meals change each day, but take the form of an appetizer, a main, and a dessert. In the dark, a meal may open with ethically-sourced foie gras paired with honey-sweet dried figs and a rich gorgonzola cream. A main course may take the form of a lobster tail, poached in butter and paired with a gelée of fennel, pickled radish, and chili-infused coconut broth, or meltingly tender Kobe beef short ribs served with thyme jam, compressed tomato, and creamy mash. Even in the dark, there’s room for dessert, especially sophisticated numbers like Manjari chocolate cremeux with a crumbly “soil” of cashew and chocolate, garnished with pink salt caramel and peanut sorbet.

"Omar Shariff Authentic Indian Cuisine","It speaks volumes of a restaurant in Singapore when it remains vibrant, popular, consistent, and firmly rooted in the same location where it all started over the years. And just like their namesake, Omar Shariff remains a timeless addition to the local dining scene - a classic restaurant serving up delicious North Indian cuisine to fans that travel from all across the island.
With chefs from Calcutta, the flavours on offer here are robust, intoxicating in their spice, and undeniably authentic. Each dish an elaborate dance of heat, spice, and flavour, with some being brash and 'hot', and others more coy and subtle in the way the various ingredients play out.

"One Bowl Restaurant & Bar","Dining at One Bowl Restaurant & Bar feels just like enjoying a home-cooked meal and chowing down on your favourite local delights at your local hawker centre all at the same time. That’s because former public servant and home cook-turned-head chef Tammie Loke is used to cooking her famed renditions of local dishes for friends and family. Today, she serves up her signature dishes at The Sultan Hotel nestled right in the heart of historic Kampong Glam.

One Bowl is a great in-between for those looking for delicious and reasonably-priced nosh but cannot stand the sweltering heat outside. Home-style spins on Singaporean favourites such as the uber aromatic Nasi Lemak with Chicken Wing & Special Otah, the hearty Claypot Rice, and the comfy Braised E-Fu Noodles become gourmet classics, dressed up with more defined and nuanced flavours. More importantly, the much-raved about Char Siew should not be missed. Choose to enjoy that melt-in-your-mouth goodness with some springy noodles or warm rice, but we reckon the best way to enjoy the perfectly-roasted meat is have it with the Fried Mantou, a heavenly combination that will leave you wanting more. Finally, wrap up the meal with some gula melaka goodness - the Chendol here strikes the right balance between gooey sweetness and delishly fragrant beans and coconut milk.

"Open Farm Community","You wouldn’t usually expect a green oasis at the heart of the city, but Open Farm Community, nestled in the verdant surroundings of Dempsey Hill, will change that perception. A revolutionary collaboration between the Spa Espirit Group, Head Chef Oliver Truesdale Jutras, Souschef Phoebe Oviedo and award-winning food garden specialists, Edible Garden City, Open Farm Community is an urban farmland, horticultural hub, and restaurant all packed into one. At the heart of it all is one simple philosophy: to provide Singaporeans with a space to reconnect with nature whilst educating the young and old about local farming and the food we eat. The sprawling outdoor space features a garden brimming with herbs and vegetable produce, as well as educational breakout spaces alongside lawn bowling lanes and table tennis tables. True to their goal of educating city dwellers about the food we eat, tours of the vegetable and fruit orchards, talks, and gardening workshops are available too. The centrepiece is the gorgeous restaurant, a building with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a high ceiling, the perfect place to unwind and tuck into some simple and honest fare.

The kitchen here adopts a strict no-no policy towards processed ingredients, imported produced, and unsustainable farming practices. This means that ingredients used here are mostly locally-sourced and always fresh - even the pasta is made fresh in-house! The menu is also one striking example of Open Farm Community’s dedication to serving honest food, with lengthy names laying out the different ingredients used in each dish. The flavours here are simple yet robust, focused around local farms and heritage, as epitomized by the Laksa Pappardelle, featuring soft shell prawn tempura, a spicy coconut based sauce and fresh laksa leaves from the garden; or the light and fresh watermelon salad, replete with lime and mint to balance the housemade ricotta from local Hay Dairies goat milk. A highlight was the Barramundi, straight from the waters off Pulau Ubin, combined with a sumptuous seaweed butter and organic dou miao, with puffed black rice crumbled over for a textural contrast.

Now, whether you’re looking for romantic date spot, or a place where the kids can have some fun, Open Farm Community definitely provides an unforgettable experience for all.

"Opus Bar & Grill","There are two things that matter when you are considering the humble steak, and that's the meat and the grill. While seasonings and sauces have their place, these two essentials go the longest way in ensuring a perfectly juicy, endlessly flavourful cut from pasture to plate. This is the philosophy of Opus Grill, the stunning new, mahogany clad steakhouse at Hilton Singapore. Featuring an impressive dining room with handsome furnishings, it has the feel of a solid modern grill experience long before you get a peek at the well-curated menu of grill basics.

The meat starts with 18 to 36 days of dry aging in a one-of-a-kind Himalayan salt tiled cabinet. The in-house curation makes a tasteful difference in the flavour and juiciness of the steak, and while there are a handful of choice cuts available, the dry-aged Rangers Valley Angus OP Rib with a Marble Score of 4 is a fast favourite. A sizeable beauty meant for two diners, the steak is carefully grilled upon an open-flame charcoal grill for an ideal flame-licked crust. Plus, you can choose from a selection of sauces and delectable side orders to go with the steak, though the grilled-to-perfection steak speaks for itself.

For less carnivorous diners, Opus is the first restaurant in the city to gain the MSC ecolabel for sustainable seafood, so you know the seafood come from the best possible place. Finish off with a charcoal grilled banana smoked with salted caramel and served with refreshing coconut and calamansi ice-cream - just the right kiss of sweetness to end your decadent evening.

"Orient Palace 禧家","A spa, restaurant, and live entertainment destination all rolled into one, Orient Palace at the Furama RiverFront is a one-of-a-kind experience that has to be seen to be believed. It helps that it’s pretty on the eyes, with a swanky interior done up with lush plants and plush seating. One can have a near-perfect day here with a trip to the spa followed by a sumptuous high-end Chinese meal, made with beneficial ingredients that will keep that post-spa glow going on for days to come. Specialties here include the Charcoal Roasted Crispy Suckling Pig, a lavish dish marinated with homemade sauces before a traditional spit-roast over the coals that results in perfectly crispy crackling and impossibly juicy flesh.

On the same luxurious track is the Braised Whole 24-Head Middle Eastern Dried Abalone with Mushroom and Vegetables, a wonder of Cantonese cuisine that’s full of rich umami flavours intensified by a 48-hour braise. Local cuisine gets a nod in the form of the Nanyang Steamed Crab with Chilli Dip, a refined take on the Singapore national dish made with Sri Lankan mud crabs and a gingery chilli sauce. For a collagen boost to top off that spa package, get the Giant Grouper Porridge, a particularly lush bowl of porridge filled with gelatinous grouper, and made with a rich seafood stock. Whether or not you take a trip to the spa, you’ll be beaming with a healthy glow after a meal of such elegance and finesse. (Jan 2018)

Thankfully, the once tucked-away establishment has now opened up cafes all over the island, bringing its quality coffee experience to downtown locations like this Pan Pacific outlet where you can grab an all-day breakfast and hearty lunch, or tipples and nibbles right in the heart of town.
The first thing you should do is order some coffee, particularly the robust hand-pours, like the Taisho White, a cold-brew enriched with a shot of their specialty M.A.D milk, a sweet nut milk made from macadamias, almonds, and dates. It's crisp, subtly sweet, and creamy without the use of any dairy. Then peruse the menu and take your pick from a comprehensive selection of brunch favourites like an all-in breakfast plate called the Fully Loaded, featuring eggs done to your liking and served alongside thick sausages, maple-glazed bacon, field mushrooms, air-dried tomatoes, baked beans, and toast. There's even a customisable Eggs Benedict option for those who like to tinker with their brunch.
Heavier plates come in the form of crisp, battered Fish & Chips, featuring red snapper and home-made tartar dip; as well as a fragrant Garlic Prawn Risotto, bouncy grilled shrimp over risotto made with a rich prawn broth. Either way, chase all that down with another cold brew, and you've got yourself the complete Oriole experience.

"Pagi Sore (Far East Square)","The first thing that hits you when you walk through the doors of Pagi Sore is the fragrant waft of coconut, garlic and spices. That and the delighted sounds of your fellow diners feasting on large plates of traditional Indonesian fare. It almost feels like you have left the hustle and bustle of the CBD and entered into a lively Indonesian village, with boisterous laughter filling the large oaken dining room, peppered with various traditional Indonesian curios. The simple, family-style seating adds to the feel of the place. Pagi Sore is your lunch or dinnertime escape from the urban jungle.
At the Far East Square outlet, subtle touches such as the display of Angklungs (a traditional Indonesian musical instrument) at the cashier counter, and little hand-carved wooden animals perched atop shelves add to the traditional feel of the place. Continuing in the vein of celebrating Indonesian culture, a rich tapestry woven with gold threads is also displayed at the front counter.
With its humble beginnings as a Nasi Padang stall, Pagi Sore has come a long way, but one thing still remains the same in all its 24 years - their sensational recipes that have drawn crowds for generations. Although Indonesian fare has a reputation of being too hot for most to handle, the tastes here have been slightly adjusted for the local palate, with a special focus on each of the five major flavours. In fact, as we journeyed through the menu, we appreciated the progression of sweet, savoury, sour, spicy and umami.
The bustling atmosphere when we visited is a testament to Pagi Sore's popularity, so be sure to make a reservation to guarantee yourself a seat. Otherwise, be ready to torturously watch as hungry patrons lap up plates of Indonesian goodness as you wait in line!

"Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant","As Singapore seafood outlets go, Palm Beach Seafood is not a restaurant, it's an institution. Established in 1956, and widely credited in the contested race of who was creator of the Singapore Chili Crab, Palm Beach has perfected its recipes and service over its long tenure. Whether you frequented the East Coast outlet back in the day with family, now visit for entertaining clients with local flair, or bring your out-of-town friends to One Fullerton for a meal and view to impress, it seems like we all know and love Palm Beach.
To those skeptics who hail a heartland hawker as more quintessentially Singaporean, we hear you. But once to have enjoyed succulent Black Pepper Crab and fresh squeezed fruit blends under crystal candelabras and the watchful eye of the Merlion, with a cooled interior to beat the heat, and a shiny, modern décor, we bet you will be a convert.
Situated at the coveted spot where the Singapore River meets Marina Bay, views are second-to-none. While news of Palm Beach's greatness has drawn crowds from all over, our secret to avoid tourists is to be seated indoors. Expansive windows allow views to be just as idyllic, and we find that the temperature is more conducive to digging in to their various delicacies.
And what delicacies there are! Sparing no expense in sourcing the freshest of seafood, vegetables and ingredients for house-made sauces, it is a pleasant surprise to see that price tags for dishes have seemingly not changed that much from 1956! Recipes have been fine-tuned since then, but classics like Sri Lankan crab prepared 11 different ways, and Honey Tangy Fish remain largely the same and will always be held close to our hearts, and stomachs.

"Panamericana","This sweeping spot exudes elegance from the moment you step in. With a colonial chic vibe - think darkwood furniture, ornate fittings, and exquisite tiling - Panamericana is definitely not your average American restaurant. Dedicated to bringing a taste of North, Central, and South America to diners, this spot specialises in juicy glazed meats - grilled to perfection in the traditional Asador Argentino oven, tipples, and fresh seafood.

The menu here is divided into Smalls and Bigs, so diners can order based on their appetites. The Texas Pork Belly Sliders are a hot favourite - literally! Bite-size burgers made with juicy pork belly and topped with a mix of fiery Sriracha mayonnaise and red cabbage slaw, these little sliders will leave you wanting more. For a taste of the best America has to offer, opt for the Land & Sea - a rich dish of crispy pork belly, scallops, chipotle caramel, and tangy salsa. The generous serving of meat, as well as the sweet and spicy accompaniments make this the perfect dish to share with a friend.

Barflies will be more than content with the range of cocktails here. The Lynchburg Ice Lemon Tea is perfect in Singapore’s sweltering weather. A herbal and fruity infusion with a shot of Jack Daniel’s this dish is perfect with one of the meaty mains.

Perfect with a glass of red, this dish features fresh salami, crisp parma ham, cooked ham, and mortadella. Clueless about pairings? Ask one of the friendly staff for a recommendation.

"Pasta Brava","There is something to be said about restaurants that outlast the competition by sticking to tradition. If you've lived in Singapore for a while, chances are you've heard about Pasta Brava. And it wouldnt be surprising if the name conjures up word associations like ""authentic Italian"", and ""delicious"".
East truly meets west as the Luceri family serves traditional Italian dishes at a conservation shophouse in Tanjong Pagar. With its central location, it's perfect for corporate lunches or romantic dinners, and if you don't believe us, perhaps the numerous accolades that take up an entire wall near the entrance can back up our claim.
They deserve a standing ovation and a ""Bravissima!"" for their simple yet delicious renditions, many of whose ingredients can be counted on one hand like the Insalata Caprese and Calamari Fritti. The extensive menu has you covered from antipasti to dolci, but as their name suggests, the homemade pastas are their specialty.
Consider their signature dish, the Mezzelune Ripiene di Zucca. Half moon shaped pumpkin ravioli comes in a divine red capsicum cream sauce. At first bite, you get the sweetness of the pumpkin, which is then finished off with the sweetness of the red capsicum. Between this and their chocolate lava cake, we're hard-pressed to choose which the sweeter escape is.

"Pasta J","A speciality restaurant offering exceptional Western dishes with sensible locals flavours, unlike those offered anywhere else.

Since day one, Pasta J has focused on one thing: really intense flavours. They have always done this through sheer effort to caramelise, reduce, smoke, brine, cure, inject, pressure-cook, de-stem, age and cleverly blend many ingredients for great depths of flavour. All done in-house.

They caramelise onions, mushrooms et cetera for hours and reduce the stock from ten kilograms of lobster heads to just one kilogram. Hours are also spent butchering meat to produce very few servings and fruits are even cured for two weeks to one month in order to make their own Limoncello and other liqueurs… you get the idea. Most dishes are results of multiple stages of extremely labourious, careful preparation instead of simple methods of cooking and one can be assured that shortcuts are not taken at Pasta J. It is this good old-fashioned focus on cooking and not just the conventional emphasis on the ingredients, or even the current priority that creativity takes, that makes Pasta J unique.

"Paulaner Bräuhaus","The grand dame of German hangouts here in Singapore, Paulaner Brauhaus is the only German microbrewery in Singapore, and has been delighting Singaporeans with its superb, full-bodied beers for years. The Brauhaus is also a stellar Bavarian restaurant, churning out plates of meaty German favourites to go with those beers, as well as heaps of friendly German “Geselligkeit,” or “sociability”.

Channeling an authentic German tavern, the trappings here are gorgeous and rustic, and usher you into a truly German experience. The food does the rest. The great classics of the cuisine are all here, including a massive Roasted Whole Pork Knuckle on the bone, served with tart Sauerkraut and Bavarian bread dumplings. There’s also German meatloaf, called Leberkas, served grilled with a side of fresh cucumber salad, a sunny side up egg, and rich Bavarian mustard. Deep from the heart of Bavaria comes the Beef Beer Goulash, a rich beef stew given extra layers of flavour by some dark beer, served with mounds of Bavarian egg noodles to soak up all that delicious gravy.

It’s not German food without an entire section of the menu dedicated to sausages, and here you can get your fix of Currywurst, Munich Weisswurst, and herby Sausage Snail. Pile on the meat with a serving of Schnitzel, a battered cutlet of pork or chicken, served with a variety of sauces that will forever change your mind about German food being bland and uninteresting. Needless to say, chug down some beers. They’re brewed on-site and are some of the tastiest on the island. (Feb 2018)

"The Pelican","Predating the newfound trendiness of American Southern seafood boils and lobster roll mania, The Pelican is a local captain of seafarers' fare from the American Northeast with superbly done, can't-get-enough New England seafood classics, all from a fitting locale on Fullerton Pier.
With all the tasting, sampling and general feasting done by the Chope team, it's surprisingly difficult to reach a consensus on the best restaurants in the city. However, The Pelican achieves that nearly impossible task with unanimous and repeated endorsements from everyone who has had the pleasure of dining there. The secret to its success could be its loyal, no-frills approach to its concept, forgoing fusion and fuss for consistently brilliant dishes. The seafood is sustainably-sourced, a daunting but fulfilling challenge for the kitchen, and the menu thankfully does not stray from its fortes.
The Baked Snapper Pie is a universal winner, featuring a share-worthy ramekin of toothsome fish, a thick, creamy sauce, tender vegetables and a crust so flaky that even a bona fide bakery would be jealous. Enough good things cannot be said about this dish, the only one of its kind and quality in Singapore. Another fan favourite? Their namesake Grilled Seafood Platter that comes filled with baked oysters, squid, barramundi, and baked lobster, and best enjoyed with a friend or two on The Pelican Deck while savouring sensational views of Marina Bay.
For a more refined atmosphere, anchor your group in the chic dining room and bar area. Its interiors feature a mix of odds and ends, offset by a wave-like marbled floor and beveled glass doors, while the al fresco area is more of a rustic, sailors' retreat. The flashes of gleaming copper plates, and an eye-popping, hot pink acrylic seahorse adds a touch of whimsy that elevates the indoors to the level of any fine dining hotspot in Singapore.

But its main restaurant at Keppel is where you can get the whole deal: a massive range of traditional Peranakan dishes, lovingly prepared, and brought to you by attentive service staff determined to make your meal a satisfying one. There’s far more than the usual suspects here, a whole treasure trove of home-cooked favourites greets you as you open the menu. Start off the meal with the hard-to-find Jantung Pisang Kerabu, a rice salad tossed with piquant banana bud, shredded mango, cucumber, and the fiery house sambal belacan, and shredded coconut. Soup’s next, and the formidable Itek Tim, with its tart mix of preserved mustard, pork trotters, and duck in a rich broth, will whet your appetite for more.

Chicken and pork take pride of place here, and they do it well, whether you’re having it with a heavenly braise spiked with Buah Keluak (a rich, oily nut with rich, creamy flesh), or in a sweet red curry, like Ayam Kleo, this will be the centrepiece of your meal, with lots of rich, umami gravy for ladling over platefuls of perfectly steamed rice.

The founder, Saran, saw a bar that is to feel just like home, a place where family members could be a part of. Holland Village was the perfect location for its nightlife, and even more appropriate for creating a bar that was to be a neighborhood hangout. The vision for The Pit was to be a palace where anyone could go to.


Today, as The Pit continues to welcome new crowds, it’s recognized by many as a bar-focused chill-out brand. Regulars of The Pit have found an affinity with brands like Archipelago Brewery, which is a brand of local craft beers that The Pit has been carrying since 2009. While the menu constantly evolves to better serve, the legacy of The Pit will always remain true to its founder’s vision – a homely place away from home. (Jul 2019)

The rest of the design is as if stepping into the mind of a graphic designer, complete with techy textures of chrome and wire, along with charming infographic posters displaying optimal wine and beer pairings. It’s a refreshingly minimal, but not understyled look that shows a new side to the tired hipster aesthetic, and a very unexpected one for a pizza restaurant.

Let the posters guide you to your ideal beverage, picking from the small but efficient bar of beers and wines on tap. From the menu, the pizzas are the obvious choice, in which you can taste the handiwork of that impressive oven.  The Funghi Scarmorza features a woodsy mix of mushrooms with a drizzle of truffle oil and rich melted cheese that’s an immediate palate pleaser. The Prosciutto Crudo con Rucola is another winner with more than the usual volume of toppings of Parma ham and peppery rocket suspended in a milky mozzarella. The Vegetariana has the same cheese, which is cut nicely by balsamic grilled eggplant, capsicum and zucchini. All the pizzas are grounded by a tasty crust, chewy in the center and bubbled and scorched at the edges. A variety of pastas is also available for the non-pizza straggler of your dining party. Cap off the meal with a heavenly scented, creamy Saffron Panna Cotta and you won’t be disappointed!

"Pizza Maru (Bugis+)","Western street food has long embraced the punchy flavours of Korean food, and Korean-Western hybrids have found their way into tacos, pastas, and fried chicken, so why not pizza? Pizza Maru is a bonafide Korean pizza experience direct from Korea. Here you’ll find some exciting pizza flavours, applying a zany Korean sensibility to everyone’s favourite meal-in-a-pan. The pizzas here aren’t Korean because they slap kimchi onto everything: they’ve become famous for straddling a particularly Korean line between savoury pizza and sweet pastry, and it’s an odd-sounding combination that really works.
Think the Real Chicago, a deep-dish style pizza topped with stretchy string cheese, pepperoni, Parmesan cheese, Maru’s trademark tomato sauce, and a dusting of icing sugar for some savoury-sweetness. Or the Real BBQ Chicago, the same pizza given extra depth of flavour with caramelized onions, potatoes, BBQ sauce, almond flakes, and a silky cream cheese mousse. For more obviously Korean flavours, get the HI Steak Chicago, the chewy dough topped with beef steak, bulgogi beef, and pepperoni for a triple-meat experience. Then there’s the Gangnam Cowboy topped with steak, bulgalbi sauce, and roasted vegetables atop an earthy green tea crust.
If you thought you’d walk into a Korean comfort food joint without any fried chicken, you were wrong! There’s fried chook galore with a variety of sticky glazes ranging from Garlic to Sweet Chili, and crispy varieties like the Honey Butter Coat and the irresistible Original Fry. The flavours are punchy, the food mega indulgent, and the pizza is super innovative. Top that with the funky decor, and this is definitely one for the gram.

"Place to READ","Greek food isn’t exactly a common sight in Singapore, so based on that alone the grub at Place to READ stands out. That would mean little, however, if the food wasn’t authentic and delicious, but fret not - the restaurant’s commitment to good food is obvious from the very first bite. That, together with a relaxed ambience and attentive service staff, makes for a meal to remember.

If you’re looking to have a little taste of Greece, then dig into a large helping of Moussaka, an oven-baked casserole made of grilled eggplant, minced beef, decadently creamy cheese, and various spices. Hot, rich, and a real belly buster, it’d be a rare person who didn’t come away from it feeling satisfied. Do try the Grilled Stuffed Squid with Feta Cheese as well – every chewy mouthful is enhanced by the fragrance of sliced garlic. It’s not an overly complicated dish, but man if it isn’t good.

Place to READ doesn’t just serve Greek food – there’s a great selection of pastas and pizzas too, among other Western fare. You won’t regret the Chilli Crab Sauce Pasta, with an authentic take on the sauce that won’t disappoint fans of the Singaporean classic. Served with helpings of scallop and shrimp, you’re sure to get every cent of your money’s worth. Hearty, good value, and a good place to unwind – that just about sums up Place to READ!

"Pollen","Where do we start with Pollen? Everything from the food, to the ambience, to its location has been the subject of an incredible amount of excitement, and when you step into the restaurant, it's not hard to see why.
We have been told that stepping into the Flower Dome is like stepping into Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory and we can think of no better analogy. The curving majesty of the glass dome looms over you, and if you're there during the day, you'll find yourself surrounded by colourful flora of all types. Stop and take a deep breath, and you'll notice the tantalising scents of lavender and rosemary amidst the sweet bouquet of the flowers that seem as numerous as stars in a clear night sky. The very first time we visited Pollen, we were speechless. And considering how verbose some of the Chope team are, that's no easy feat.
The modern European fare with a Mediterranean twist is the centrepiece of this arrangement however, and the kitchen team makes that clear. There is no compromise on creativity or produce; the restaurant grows their own herbs in the dome, and there's a dignified simplicity in the dishes on offer. Signature dishes like the baby beets salad, pollen from the garden, Hokkaido scallop tartare, oyster emulsion are of course must-tries, with other eye-catching items like the Rangers Valley 300-day tenderloin, Wagyu beef cheek, chicory, parmesan cream are definitely worth at least a dabble.

"Praelum Wine Bistro","Looking for a place to improve your knowledge of your libations? Look no further. Named after the device used to extract juice from crushed grapes, Praelum is one of the few places that has been continuously lauded by Wine & Dine Magazine for their excellent wine list. There is also a selection of cheeses and other dishes for diners’ pairings.

With a walk-in cellar home to over a thousand bottles of carefully procured wines and a bottle list that changes weekly, this is one place that truly knows its grapes. Wines are sold by the glass using the Enomatic and Coravin wine preservation systems, which minimises spoilage of the wine. The knowledgeable sommeliers are also able to advise diners and make recommendations for different palates.

Diners can pair their choice of wine with farmhouse cheese platters and truffle honey. The tarte flambee is another good option, and comes with a range of premium toppings, including roma tomatoes and gruyere cheese. For something a little moreish, opt for the Stockyard Wagyu Ribeye. The fresh cut of beef is cooked to your liking and slathered in a rich beef demi glace sauce which gives the dish a strong flavour without overpowering the taste of the meat.

"Prata Alley","What do you get when you fry a bit of dough in ghee? None other than light and fluffy roti prata. This humble South Indian staple has long been a go-to dish for many people across all walks of life, who find themselves chowing down on this dish at all hours of the day.

And as big fans of this simple dish, we know that some of the best prata can be found in Clementi at a little establishment called Prata Alley, located in the shopping mall 321 Clementi. Unlike your old-school neighbourhood joints, Prata Alley kicks this dish up a notch, serving up inventive fare. One such dish is the The Big One, which seamlessly blends a mozzarella cheese prata base with pizza toppings such as pesto chicken and shiitake mushrooms.

You can expect other specialties too, such as the Turmeric Rush, which showcases a generous plate of nasi goreng cooked with a special blend of spices. Of course diners who prefer traditional dishes would enjoy Prata Alley’s rendition of Chicken Sambal Briyani, where you can bite into chunks of chicken that’s both tender and spicy at the same time.

By putting a new spin onto the age-old prata dish, Prata Alley has created a bevy of delicious and innovative dishes for all to enjoy. (Jun 2018)

"Preludio","Preludio is a contemporary dining concept from Fernando Arévalo that moves with time in orchestrated chapters.
The word preludio, which may be translated as “introduction” or “prelude”, alludes to the constant beginning of something new.
For its debut, Preludio will open with Monochrome, where the restaurant will be inspired in black and white. To remove colour from an object is to strip it down to its fundamental self – everything raw and everything pure. Opening with this rudimentary idea of black and white seemed only befitting for Preludio as it embarks on this unconventional journey.

"Princess Terrace Cafe","It really says something about a restaurant when it has stayed in business as long as Princess Terrace Cafe has. Serving up mouthwatering Penang fare since the early 1970s, the restaurant has remained a reliable stalwart in Singapore’s ever-evolving, competitive dining landscape. It’s the perfect place to indulge in familiar comfort food and gobble up a never-ending parade of goodies till your stomach’s fit to burst.

Dive right into helpings of Chicken Curry, a fragrant, hearty dish that has a depth of flavour which hits all the right notes. The Fu Rong Crab Egg is another must-try option, with generous measures of crab – you’ll be finding it hard to tear yourself away from this one once you’ve started. And you can’t go wrong with a hot, yummy bowl of Penang Prawn Mee; not many places in Singapore do this famed dish justice, but here at Princess Terrace Café, one spoonful of the almost sinfully flavourful broth is enough to get you hooked. They certainly don’t stint on the good stuff when it comes to making the broth!

Buffet restaurants are a dime a dozen in Singapore, but Princess Terrace Cafe has endured through the decades, and for good reason. It’s a go-to restaurant for delicious, traditional Penang cuisine in the eyes of many Singaporeans – the perfect place for you to stuff yourself silly! (Aug 2017)

Beef Ribeye Cap steak, Wagyu Striploin, and Pork Neck are just some of the premium cuts of meat you can order and cook to desired doneness at this spot. The highlight of the menu may be the delicious cuts of meat, but there is also a host of side dishes or baechu on offer here.

The Black Angus Tomahawk is the meaty star of the menu, a heaving joint of meat served with seasonal vegetables and crispy fries. Also good is the sinful Pork Knuckle complete with shattering crackling, and the Pulled Pork Burger that’s more meat than bun.

The restaurant operations team asks for genuine feedback from their guests, are shower diners with hospitality like few others in Singapore. You can sense it in the way they joke with the guests and with each other.

Food wise, not to state the obvious, but we were astounded by the grilled kebabs - the meats are infused with a smoky first bite and juicy aftertaste. These should definitely be your first stop, but do leave some space for the curries. The Saag Gosht (baby lamb and spinach) was a perfect pairing of flavours without feeling too thick or heavy.

Punjab is known for its diverse foods and is particularly famous for its milk, which is why you should not miss out on having a portion of the Daal Punjab Grill, a dish which is creamy and best enjoyed piping hot. Dip some crispy paratha or a garlic naan into the rich sauce, take a bite, and enjoy.

"Quaich Bar (South Beach)","At Quaich Bar, we believe that the love for fine whisky always begins with an exquisite dream.
Stocking more than 500 varieties of fine whisky, the bar is a warm embrace from the bustle of city life.
Quaich Bar is one of the most exquisite whisky bars in Singapore. Since its opening in 2007, it has played host to countless social gatherings among friends and catered to the every need of business leaders looking to entertain colleagues or clients with a taste for the finer things in life. In the true spirit of this tradition, it is therefore apt that Quaich (pronounced ‘quake’) is named after the Gaelic cup, a symbol of welcome and friendship.
We started in 2005 as a humble retail kiosk in Tanglin Mall called “The Whisky Store”. At that time, the market lacked a dedicated whisky bar so we pursued our passion, opening Singapore’s first whisky bar a year later at Waterfront Plaza.
The venture soon reaped rewards in terms of notable accolades for our contribution to whisky culture in Singapore, being awarded the ‘Great Whisky Bar of the World’ title by the international whisky publication ‘Whisky Magazine’ in 2006. In 2007 the bar was renamed Quaich Bar, as it remains today.
In 2010, Quaich Bar was voted ‘Top 10 Best Unique Bars’ by regional gastronomic publication, ‘Epicure’. It has since become a stop-over for master distillers from around the world who regularly conduct introductions or workshops to showcase their signature brands.

There’s also lobster, served in the house-style by lightly poaching it in a rich superior stock, or grilled till smokey and served with tomatoes and greens. Live fish, ranging from gelatinous grouper to lean seabass, comes prepared steamed in a vibrant Nyonya sauce, or in the unbeatable Hong Kong style with soy sauce. For fiery hawker-style seafood, choose the BBQ Sambal Stingray or the Wok-Fried Sambal Green Mussels. There’s also non-seafood here, like an old-school Deep Fried Lemon Sauce Chicken or Hot Plate Venison in Black Pepper Sauce for some nostalgic zi char throwbacks, and we think these are lovely additions to a table heaving with quality seafood.

The elaborate sauces and flavours of French cuisine meet the à la minute robustness of Chinese cooking, with each cuisine getting half of the menu, allowing diners to create a fascinating fusion meal unlike any other. Helmed by famed Executive Chef Jean-Charles Dubois, this restaurant spreads out over four live cooking stations that turn locally-sourced and organically-grown produce into elegant plates, a truly unique hotel buffet experience. There is also an à la carte menu that sprawls the full gamut of these two rich cuisines. In this fashion, you may see a classic pot-roasted French hen, a corn-fed beauty cooked in a pot with French potatoes and vegetables served up with a plate of stir-fried Frog Legs in a fiery Szechuan sauce. Or a beautifully slow-braised Wagyu Cheek served alongside crunchy Sweet & Sour Kurobuta Pork, or scallion-kissed wok-fried Angus Beef Cubes.
Both cuisines unite in their love for seafood. On the French side, there’s a massive platter of premium Fruits de Mer (fruits of the sea), including Alaskan king crab, freshly shucked oysters, and scallop carpaccio on an iced platter. On the Chinese side, the ubiquitous Abalone, except here served sashimi-style with a sea urchin sauce and a sprinkling of lemony breadcrumbs. Dessert is a grab-bag of options: delicate French gateaux flavoured with strawberries, dark chocolate, or praline rub shoulders with Asian flavours like red bean, yuzu, and mango sticky rice.

"Ramen eki","The Ramen craze is as crazy as ever, and this spot in the heartlands of the Northeast is set to delight by bringing fresh noodles made with premium ingredients in-house. Located in Wisteria Mall, this restaurant specialises in Hakata Ramen, which is made with noodles that are thinner than usual, which means that they are more chewy and go down much easier than regular noodles. The small layout allows patrons to have a cosy dining experience.

The Eki Supreme Ramen is the must-try here, and for good reason. Served with boiled egg, pork, corn, and tamago, this dish is rich, flavourful, and best enjoyed hot. There is the option to cook the noodles in Tonkotsu - pork bone - broth, or Miso. Adventurous diners can even opt for Spicy Miso Ramen, a concoction of earthy chilli broth with noodles and meat. Diners looking for something other than ramen are sure to enjoy the Oyakodon, a traditional Japanese dish made with chicken, egg, and rice wine. The crisp Chicken Karaage is also a great finger food option for diners who are feeling peckish. Prefer seafood? The juicy Takoyaki balls are all you will ever need in your life.

"The RANCH Steakhouse By ASTONS","We know Astons for making steak affordable. Now, our favourite chain is taking it up a notch with their new outfit, The Ranch Steakhouse. The classic steakhouse sits along Clarke Quay with al fresco seating, so you get a great view to go with your meats.

The Ranch focuses on great beef here. Start with the Beef Tartare, hand-chopped tenderloin with plenty of delicious spices, and laced with a generous dash of XO cognac. Pan-fried Foie Gras is great if you’re looking to indulge — the fatty goose liver comes with an oozy soft-boiled egg, dried apricots and raspberries, and a warm, umami-packed bacon dressing.

Of course, meat is the star of the show at The Ranch. The New Zealand Grass-Fed Black Angus Sirloin is juicy and tender, and priced at great value. If you love the funky flavours that come with dry-ageing beef, try the USDA Prime 30 Days Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye. The cut is served bone-in, and the steak has a delicious buttery sear. You also get tableside service when you order this cut, so sit back and feel like a VIP.
To go with your meats, order from an extensive range of wines or get a pint of German beer from the bar.

"Rang Mahal","The granddaddy of traditional, upmarket Indian restaurants in Singapore, Rang Mahal has been a trailblazer and standard bearer since 1971. Located within the Pan Pacific Hotel, the elegant decor is the first thing that ushers you into an outstanding dining experience. Moving away from ostentatious traditional design, the look here is subtle, restrained, and very sophisticated, done up in washes of warm reds as you enter and then softening to soft earth tones and touches of gold in the dining area.


Refinement continues on the plate. The award-winning cuisine here features dishes from across all of India’s major regions, from the coastal cities to the hubs of the North and South. Expect beautifully-plated food with rich and intense flavours. Seafood is done exceptionally well here. Your meal begins with delicate appetizers like Tava Scallops with spicy lashings of green chilli and coconut, announcing, from the get-go, the restaurant’s knack for sourcing quality ingredients in pursuit of true and authentic flavours. Mains include tandoor-roasted Samarkand Prawns stuffed with crabmeat, piquant ginger, and garlic, and King Tandoori Lobster still singing from a smoky tandoor heightened with smoked cinnamon. A major highlight here is classic Indian bread, a humble accompaniment to the meal that the chefs at Rang Mahal have elevated into an art with extra gourmet touches: crisp naan is given a slick of fragrant truffle, and chewy kulcha is stuffed with fruity Roquefort. Luxury in unexpected places and tradition executed with panache, there’s a reason Rang Mahal has been the name to beat for over thirty years.

The space is simple, perhaps odd for a restaurant along the popular Clarke Quay, but herein lays a subtle nod to its exquisite gastronomy. Head indoors if you prefer a quiet and cosy dining experience or take a seat along the bustling riverfront for great views - either way, prepare yourself for delightful appetisers such as the RAS Mixed Grill, where succulent skewers of Chicken Tikka, Malai Kebab, Mutton Seekh, Fish Tikka, and Tandoor Prawn are grilled to perfection, or the Paneer Kathi Roll, where slices of cottage cheese are tossed with onions, tomatoes, and capsicum and wrapped in thin kerchief, a killer combination that will have coming back for more. For mains, the Lobster Masala is a chef special you don’t wanna miss, while classic curries such as the Butter Chicken and the Aloo Gobhi do not disappoint. Scoop all the goodness up with some Naan or Roti, and knock them down with some tipples chosen from their extensive list of fine wines, internationally-acclaimed beers, and cocktails.

"Red House (Clarke Quay)","A decades-old operation originally from the East Coast, Red House upholds the tradition of classic seafood dishes with a focus on freshness.
Established in 1976 in a literal red house in East Coast, the restaurant has had its roots in the community for some time now, and its growth to various outlets across the island is a testament to its tasty fare. The original red house was a bastion for just-caught fish and crustaceans, delivered fresh from local fishing boats. The crimson-coloured facade was a symbol of prosperous and communal dining, further adorned with traditional red lanterns.
Now, the Clarke Quay outlet has very few red-coloured accoutrements, as the decor takes on a more understated look. For a casual step up from the outdoor seafood restaurants, this incarnation of Red House fits the bill perfectly, favouring simple functionality over flair. The one red item that's not going anywhere though, is their famed Chilli Crab, and with good reason. While there's much debate over which recipe reigns supreme in Singapore, Red House is consistently named among the top contenders. Here, the spicy gravy tastes especially homemade and doesn't mask the freshness of the crab.
With a bilingual menu written in both English and Chinese, Red House offers patrons a wealth of seafood options split into categories, all kept at more reasonable price points than you may expect. Prepared using a mix of Chinese and local Singaporean cooking methods, menu items include savoury dishes, like Fried Hor Fun, Lobster Pao Fan, and Creamy Custard Sauce Lobster that are all absolute must-tries.

"Riders Café","While blue ribbons at horse shows and debating the virtues of riding ""Western"" versus ""English"" may not be top of mind for most Singaporeans, the old headquarters of the Bukit Timah Saddle Club seems to be more popular than ever before. Why? Word on the street (or shall we say ""at the stables"") is that first-time restaurateur Janice Yeo has converted the Bukit Timah Saddle Club's old clubhouse from an archaic and underappreciated relic of Singapore's colonial past to one of the most popular dining destinations in Singapore.
With a charmingly rustic ambience, the new clubhouse is cooled by beautiful ceiling fans and fresh air spilling through seemingly numerous windows along the wall. The al fresco area also affords the opportunity to enjoy a meal with a view of Bukit Timah’s lush greenery. If you’re lucky, you may even see a horse trotting by.
However, it’d be a mistake to just associate the Riders Café with its equestrian heritage. We’d be remiss if we didn’t mention Riders Café’s brunch.

At its helm is Chef Masahiro Takada, who has established himself as a trailblazer and a creator of superb Japanese-Italian fare. With a strong emphasis on the freshness of ingredients used, Chef Takada ensures the extraordinary standard and quality of his food. The restaurant uses fresh seafood, such as Hokkaido scallops and sea urchin, which are imported directly from the famed Tsukiji market in Tokyo.
The squid ink taglioni topped with sea urchin is sublime, with the combination of ingredients releasing a delightful blend of flavours on the taste buds. We also highly recommend the Wagyu tenderloin steak which is cooked to perfection, bringing out the full magnificent texture of the beef. These are all found on the July 2016 dinner menu, and are just a few examples of Chef Takada’s varied and exquisitely unique creations.

Mains here are meaty, fiery, and unapologetically aromatic. Vietnamese Shaking Pepper Beef is a sizzling plate of tender beef slices tossed in a heavenly black pepper sauce, while the Thai take comes in the form of Grilled Beef with Spicy Tamarind Sauce. Beef Rendang takes us into Indonesian territory, and a steaming plate of white rice is the perfect accompaniment to all of them. A meal here would not be complete with a steaming bowl of soup or soup noodles, including a very good rendition of the Vietnamese classic Pho Bo, Thai Tom Yum Goong, and Indonesian Sop Ikan Batam, a red snapper fillet in a soup of pickles, tomatoes, fried onions, lemon, and fragrant basil.

The High Tea at The Rose Veranda is something of an experience. Pairing elegant dining with an exquisite tea selection, it's impossible not to fall in love with the High Tea buffet here.

Their freshly baked breads and elegantly curated salads are perfect for light bites, but heavier dishes such as Beef Bourguignon and Laksa are also available for those who prefer something a little more hearty.

Bathed in bright sunlight in the day and romantically candle-hued in the night, this is a space that makes you feel like royalty.

From clocks from various time zones, to an LED track that mimics a runway, this spot has it all. The love for all things flight doesn’t just stop at the decor either.

You might expect to come face-to-face with pages of meats once you crack open the menu, given its name, but, refreshingly enough, it starts off with plenty of seafood appetisers. Barbecued Shrimp, Sizzlin’ Jumbo Scallops, their signature Blue Crab Cakes; all good reminders that there’s more to this steak house than just beef. Go a little further, however, and you’ll strike gold: custom-aged Midwestern beef that come in all sorts of cuts, from Ribeye and Porterhouse to Petite Filet for those with a smaller appetite. Pair your juicy, perfectly grilled steaks – which come on a piping hot plate – with a Bleu Cheese Crust, get it Oscar Style with crab cakes, asparagus, and béarnaise sauce, or throw your diet plan out and add on other succulent mains such as Fresh Lobster or an Ahi-Tuna Stack.

RVLT is an oasis in the middle of the concrete jungle that is Singapore, a home away from home for Singaporeans to unwind and just have fun. We get bored quite easily so we sought to create a wine and food program that radiates good energy in a spontaneous manner. No pretence and no judgement - a good time is what we know you deserve.

At RVLT, we believe in the philosophy of quality, sustainable and natural produce for food and wine.

For wines, Al Gho and Ian Lim likes to present whatever they like to drink! Some may say their taste is weird, or that their wines are too funky. However there are others like them from around the world which gives them hope that they’re are not alone. Showcasing wines with energy and enticing excitement and creating the joy of discovery with every bottle. Above all, they just love real wines made by real people.

Named sabar, Japanese for mackerel, one of Japan’s most popular fish, beloved for its rich, oily flavour and tender flesh, is, here, prepared several ways.

Raw and lightly torched slices are served as sushi or sashimi, highlighting its sweet and meaty natural flavour. Fillets are grilled to get perfectly crispy skin hiding smooth, buttery chunks of fish beneath. Lightly smoked, the fish is served in crunchy salads, and lightly simmered in dashi and soy sauce, it’s a topping for ramen and hearty bowls of soup. Beyond familiar Japanese ways of serving mackerel, they’ve got creative takes like a crispy deep-fried mackerel dish served with a punchy, exclusive-to-Singapore chili sauce, as well as mackerel served rolled up in rice-flour wraps and crunchy greens like a Vietnamese roll.

With a warm but muted palette of colours used for the carpets and upholstery, the restaurant’s interior exudes an elegance that’ll make an impression from the very beginning. And that impression will just keep growing once you take in the selection of exquisite French-influenced dishes in the menu.

If you’re looking to try something from the a la carte menu, the Hamachi is a great option for a starter. The hay-smoked pieces of Hamachi with ponzu sauce, oba, and leek make for a light appetiser with a delicious balance of flavours. As for the mains, meat lovers will delight in the Wagyu, where seared ohmi wagyu beef is accompanied by turmeric and choron. It’s a fine example of when preparation techniques complement the uniquely exquisite qualities of the beef itself, and you’ll definitely relish every bite. Finally, to end off your meal, why not try the Pineapple, where XP5-marinated pineapple, lemongrass, meringue, and coconut come together to make for a tangy, thoroughly refreshing dessert? Possessed of flavours that’ll linger even after the last mouthful, but not too heavy or cloying, it’s the perfect denouement to an equally perfect meal. This is all from the a la carte menu, but the restaurant also offers a course menu too, with Classic, Discovery, and Adventure options – selections which you’re sure to love.

"Sakunthala's Food Palace","Little India is dotted with Indian restaurants, but what makes Sakunthala’s Food Palace interesting is not only their long history as one of Singapore’s best established Indian food chains, but also their use of traditional cooking techniques. Tandoori dishes are still cooked in a traditional oven, and their thosai recipe has remained unchanged for over thirty years. The interior of their latest joint on Race Course Road is inspired by the Mughal palaces of old, and seats 100 guests in an elegant, traditionally Indian setting.

The decor isn’t the only traditionally Indian thing about this place though. The menu is bursting with classic Indian dishes. Tear into some Thosai - a leavened flatbread fried in a light layer of clarified butter and served with coconut-based curries of your choice. There are several unique variations on offer as well, like the Masala Thosai and Egg Thosai - essentially Thosai stuffed with a spicy potato curry and egg, respectively.

No Indian restaurant would be worth its salt without the famed Fish Head Curry, and no one does it better than Sakunthala’s. Despite the array of seafood items on the menu, this curry remains a crowd favourite, and for good reason. The aromatic stew of vegetables, spices, and fish makes for a mouthwatering combination.

"SandBank","Soak up the sea-side views and beach atmosphere at East Coast park from this casual family gastropub. While the interiors are handsome and look like a classic, no-frills sports bar, the outside is pure Singapore with sun, surf, and a 15 metres long plunge pool for kids that lends the joint a fun, beach resort feel. Perfect for families, or anyone on the beach looking to tuck into its selection of generous Western plates and cocktails.
Think meaty sharing plates straight off the kitchen’s nifty charcoal grill, like a crisp-skinned charcoal-grilled chicken leg, or pleasantly charred US Black Angus Ribeye with roasted whole garlic, caramelized onions, and sweet pommery mustard. If in doubt, opt for a platter, like the Grilled Sausage Platter featuring chorizo, Italian sausages, and beef sausages with gherkins and zingy mustard. The signature SandBank Fish & Chips, made with battered seabass and served with fries and homemade Asian-inspired tartare sauce, makes the perfect beach-side lunch. If it’s a group situation, grab a few pizzas and spoil yourselves with flavours like the BBQ Pulled Pork, which sees chewy dough topped with a tangy and savoury shreds of pork, onions, and pineapples, and the elegant Verdura, a vegetarian number strewn with artichokes, mushroom, pimento, and spinach. On top of all this, look out for its sumptuous international breakfast and brunch buffet on weekends!
The name SandBank has it right: swim ashore for a breather, chow down on some great bites, and then head back out to enjoy the rest of your day out at the coast.

At this uber-laidback eatery located on Upper Paya Lebar Road, the kitchen spins out a wide array of Western and fusion fare injected with a local twist. Tuck into top nosh such as a platter of sticky Saturday’s Marmite Wings so good you’ll even lick the sauce off your fingers. Or how about the Crispy Sio Bak, where fatty and tender pork belly is found underneath a crispy crackling skin. We also love their wide variety of grilled items, from their BBQ Chicken Leg that’s coated in a sticky-sweet sauce to the sinfully mouthwatering Saturday’s Beef Burger. And for just a few dollars more, we like to add a creamy Mushroom Soup as a way to round out our meal.

Rounding off the relatively compact menu are sweet treats like the Pistachio Panna Cotta which sound too good to pass up. It's difficult to believe this eatery had their first debut in a humble coffeeshop!

While all the pastas here are done well, the Penne Alla Carbonara deserves special mention for seamlessly blending pecorino cheese and egg yolk into a creamy mixture that is flavourful without being too rich.

Luckily for us, the delightful Schmear cafe in Sentosa Cove has imported this New York deli concept onto our shores, with an emphasis on pumping out fresh hand-rolled bagels. Making a good bagel is no easy feat but Schmear has perfected the art and science of making a delicious bagel replete with a shiny crust and chewy bite. We recommend The Central Park sandwich, stuffed with spring onion cream cheese, lox, and a smattering of capers. Marrying two of NYC’s best-known foods, the Pizza Bagel is another top pick. All you have to do is pick a combination of ingredients to go on top of a tomato spread smothered over your open-faced bagel.

In addition to their bagels and cafe nosh, Schmear also boasts a drink menu comprising espresso, cold-pressed juices, smoothies, craft beers, wine, and champagne. On a hot day, we love the Aco-Coco smoothie where avocados, spinach, and coconut water are blended with a touch of honey.

Under the masterful hands of Executive Chef, Dickson Fung, Se7enth promises diners a relaxing evening with dishes centred around classic, contemporary Western fare.

Start your evening with the Caprese Salad, where slices of chewy buffalo mozzarella are paired with a generous helping of fresh Roma tomatoes, arugula leaves, basil, and topped off with a drizzle of balsamic vinaigrette. Hungry carnivores should definitely pick the Australian Grain-Fed Rib-Eye Steak. Weighing at 200 grams, this sizzling chunk of meat slides right off the grill and onto your table, making it a feast for your eyes and stomach alike.

Se7enth Restaurant also boasts an impressive selection of Asian and local cuisine, and truth be told, we simply can’t get enough of the Chili Crab Pasta. The appetizing dish is served with a rich, mouthwatering sauce with shredded crabmeat, that packs a punch. But the piece de resistance is the fried soft-shell crab; providing a light crunch with a strong, wonderful flavour.

"SHAO","It goes without saying that you can’t cook without fire. So it’s no wonder why SHAO 烧 pays tribute to this oh-so important element with a menu that’s centred around roast and barbecue.

Created by Chef Jack Ding who got his culinary feet wet operating a takeaway business during his university years, SHAO is a casual eatery on Frankel Avenue where you’re invited to relax and partake in a hearty meal with close friends. Several roast meats take the menu here, one notable dish being the tender and juicy SHAO Signature Roast Platter, comprising a mix of the restaurant’s roast duck and roast pork. The restaurant also spins up an amazing Crispy Roast Suckling Pig that’s crispy yet succulent in all the right places.

But that’s not all! Seafood makes an appearance on the menu too, and it is fantastic. We love the SHAO Signature BBQ Crab, which is paired with a divine Japanese-style pepper, salt and unagi sauce, while fans of oysters should definitely give the BBQ Oyster a try.  Surpassing all expectations, SHAO delivers an impressive mix of artistry, service, and quality in one great culinary experience. (Feb 2018)

"Shashlik Restaurant","Hearts across the island broke as news of Shashlik's closure spread, but then the classic Hainanese-run Western restaurant announced it would re-open under a younger generation of owners, while retaining the old world charm and staff that had kept customers happy for decades.
The endearingly twee vibe here harkens back to a day of refinement, when going out for a meal was a special occasion, and where personal, friendly service was a big part of the meal. But at Shashlik, it's also the comforting flavours that have kept customers returning over the years, starting with the pillowy dinner rolls and butter that greet you at the table, and following through to entrees like French Onion Soup, a meaty beef broth enriched with caramelized onions and a crusty cheese croute, or endearingly 60s appetizers like Egg Millionaire - chopped boiled egg, bacon bits, and parmesan gratin served in little egg cups. There's even Blinis & Caviar, served with sour cream, if you're feeling especially indulgent before your main.
We'd hold back on the appetizers though, because the shashlik, or meat grilled on skewers served straight up at the table, is very hearty. There's the classic Shashlik of Beef, juicy tenderloin rich with the flavours of a 24-hour marinade, as well as pork, chicken, and lamb. If you like your meat cooked more conventionally, there's also grilled steaks. But one of our favourite ways of eating meat here is in one of Shashlik's classic old-world stews: hearty, rustic Oxtail Stew and creamy Beef Stroganoff, perfect with some crusty bread or rice, and a heart full of nostalgia. For dessert: Baked Alaska, no question.
The food here may seem a little too quaint for the 21st century, but really that's part of the charm, and a rapidly disappearing one at that. So book a table while you can!

The table-side acrobatics of its Japan-trained chefs has become a part of the meal as the delicious flash-cooked dishes made from fresh ingredients. The menu has since expanded to include sushi and sashimi dishes to go along with the hot plates, satisfying that Japanese cuisine craving of yours under one roof.
The classic Teppanyaki menu features a range of premium meats cooked before your eyes to perfection. Fatty tenderloin of Wagyu, chicken thigh, buttery foie gras, live lobster, and tender salmon belly sizzle on the pan, releasing their delicious aromas as a teaser to the meal. Mounds of garlicky fried rice and fresh vegetables follow, mopping up the meaty juices for a taste of perfection. If you want to beef up your meal, order some hand rolls that are studded with everything from chopped tuna belly to braised unagi, or get a platter of sashimi to ramp up all those umami flavours swirling about in your mouth. If you hate choosing, meals here come in elegant Kaiseki-style sets, where you let the chefs prepare the meal at a luxurious pace that will leave you bursting at the seams.

Perhaps, 'joint' isn't the right word; after all, a restaurant which boasts an austere elegance and a pricey omakase menu deserves more formality. It's a venture with the founder of three Michelin star Sushi Shikon - folks who've been to this Mercer Hotel establishment in Hong Kong will likely remember its jaw-dropping price tag - so excellent Japanese food is to be expected.
Like most Japanese places which take pride in authenticity, ingredients are flown in from Tsukiji Market daily and used to great effect in the Master Chef's impressive array of omakase dishes. Let's just say that wobbling out of Shoukouwa is a possibility once you've finished two appetisers, three assorted sashimi, four cooked dishes, 13 pieces of nigiri sushi, miso soup, Japanese omelette, and dessert. The cooked dishes are great but the stars of the show are, without a doubt, the premium seafood. Slices bear none of that heavy, fishy aroma, but remain slightly salty and very sweet - as all fresh catch should be.

The dishes here combine a variety of cuisines - from Huaiying to Cantonese, with dishes ranging from spicy Pepper Chicken to soothing soups.

The popular Mala Hotpot has its roots in Sichuan cuisine, so it’s no surprise that dishes on the menu come with an extra kick. Spice fanatics will love the Mala Crab for its searing heat levels and generous portions of crab meat. Diners who prefer something less fiery can opt for the delicious Chicken Pudding - a delectable dish of meat and herbs that is perfect on a cold day. The Marinated Pig’s Trotter is another Sichuan dish that features tender pork meat soaked in a flavourful blend of herbs and spices and cooked to perfection.

The premium ingredients and fancy interior may seem too plush for some, but don’t be fooled - this restaurant is as wallet-friendly as it gets, so patrons can indulge without fear of breaking the bank. If you’re ever in River Valley and craving a taste of Chengdu, this is the place to go! (Apr 2018)

"Shukuu Izakaya","You might be forgiven for thinking that you’ve been transported to an intimate restaurant in one of Tokyo’s back alleys. Nestled cosily in the trendy yet historic corner of Stanley Street is Shukuu Izakaya, a trendy hotspot featuring a bevy of eclectic small plates that will tickle taste buds. The intimate space features iconic red lanterns and a traditional Japanese mural to create a chic vibe that makes the experience so authentic. Whether you’re looking for an eatery with friends or just a quiet, solitary dinner after work, the superb yet reasonably-priced fare gives you the perfect reason to let your hair down.

Staying true to their conviction of serving only high quality food, ingredients are sourced from leading Japanese suppliers and air-flown in fresh from Japan. The dishes here remains true to its Japanese roots while tinkling with Western influences. The Kani Gratin, or crab gratin with mentaiko, and the Rosti Mentai, where swiss-style potato shreds are drizzled with a decadent mentaiko sauce, serve as fine testaments. Shukuu Izakaya’s specialty, Kushiyaki, or charcoal-grilled skewered meat, is a must-try as well. The Omi Wagyu as well as the Kurobuta Tontoro are your best bets. For the more adventurous, the Yaki Gyu Tan, where premium beef tongue is grilled to tender perfection is sure to please as well.

The dishes here taste best when paired with sake, so choose your partner in crime from their extensive range of sakes or ask for a recommendation, and voilà, the meal’s perfect!

"Shunjuu Izakaya","Since the early Edo period, izakayas (or ‘sit-down sake shops’) have been an indispensable fixture in the Japanese way of life and a few years ago, they found their place in Singapore’s flourishing culinary landscape. Shunjuu Izakaya, situated along the beautiful Robertson Quay, adds a refreshing spritz of excitement to the modern Izakaya with their specialty in Sumiyaki, charcoal-grilled dishes which may very well be the Japanese answer to tapas.

We love the al-fresco dining space but if you’re looking for some air-conditioned comfort, the wood-filled interior and cosy booths provides a much-welcomed respite. When it comes to food, expect well-executed Japanese favourites with an emphasis on dishes that pair well with sake or shochu. As with tapas, the dishes are served as small plates made for sharing, so don’t go easy on the ordering! All 70 of their sumiyaki signatures such as the Tori Kawa Ninniku (garlic rolled with chicken skin), Tebasaki (chicken wings), Gyu Tan (ox tongue) are not to be missed of course. Cold dishes such as the Tako Wasabi (seasoned baby octopus) , the Sashimi Sarada (sashimi salad), and Tori Kawa Masago Ae (chicken skin mixed with cod roe) are also as delicious as hot plates such as the Buta Kimuchi Itame (stir-fry pork and kimchee) and the Ribuai Tataki (ribeye carparccio).

For some carbs, opt for some Soba or the delicious Ninniku Cha-han (garlic fried rice). Wash it all down with sake or shochu - a wide selection awaits, along with a detailed table which specifies the serving temperature, the prefecture of origin, and the sake meter, allowing you to make the most informed choice. We suggest you try a few. It can’t hurt, can it?

"Shutters","Time to treat yourself and end that spa day with some luxury comfort food. Shutters is located within Sentosa’s beautiful Amara Sanctuary Resort, and a full day of pampering yourself has never been easier. Even if you’re just dropping by for a meal, there’s never been a better way to escape the city; tranquil and surrounded by lush greenery, Shutters is done up in lovely earth tones, a high ceiling, and lots of access to sunlight.
Keeping the vibe relaxed but classy, the food is a mix of contemporary classics and comfort food with subtle gourmet touches. Think a seafood salad of trout caviar, smoked salmon, tuna, and prawn in a zingy yuzu dressing, a burger that you bite into only to discover mouthfuls of creamy foie gras and smoky grilled steak, plus fried rice stirred up with a fragrant XO sauce and studded with scallops and crispy Japanese shrimp. For dessert, get not one but three crème brulees in a tasting platter where you get to try creamy custard flavoured with cempedek (a sweet and pungent local fruit), coffee, and the classic vanilla. It’s time to treat yourself in style, with delicious bites in a rare pocket of quiet and greenery.

"Si Chuan Dou Hua (Beach Road)","Having first opened its doors in 1996, Si Chuan Dou Hua is no stranger to anyone serious about Chinese food. A wide array of authentic Sichuan and Cantonese fare is offered here, with a menu that stretches more than 30 pages long. Yet, quality is not compromised, and every dish boasts nuanced flavours that will tinkle with your taste buds.
Contrary to popular belief, Sichuan cuisine isn't defined by a fiery spiciness that requires a glass of water nearby at all times. We are major fans of their Sichuan Dan Dan Noodles, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Expect dishes like the Marinated Black Chinese Fungus with Preserved Chilli, the Braised Sea Cucumber in Sichuan Bean Paste, and the delicate Boiled Sliced Fish in Sichuan Pepper Sauce to blow you away with their smorgasbord of robust flavours.
Their Cantonese classics are similarly executed with finesse. The highlight is undoubtedly the dim sum here where diners are treated with an eclectic mix of old favourites and innovative creations, but double-boiled soups like the Chicken Soup with ""Lingzhi"" and dishes such as the Braised Seafood Treasures with Sliced Abalone warrant a return trip.

"Si Chuan Dou Hua (UOB Plaza)","""Are the dishes 'Sichuan spicy' or 'normal spicy'?"" we asked. The restaurant's management staff replied, ""Sichuan spicy!"" Normally we would discount that reply as pure marketing trickery, but after trying the dishes for ourselves, we were instant believers.
Welcome to Si Chuan Dou Hua, bringing you authentic Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine from its perch on the top floor of UOB Plaza 1. Complete with chefs imported in from Sichuan and Hong Kong in addition to martial arts-and-dance-trained traditional tea pourers from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, this place is as real as it gets, folks!
Although there are three outlets in Singapore, each boasting a different menu that caters to a specific clientele, the UOB location is best known for its 30% Sichuan and 70% Cantonese split menu. This makes it ideal for hosting clients since it's probably best to avoid the faux pas of entertaining guests while drenched in a fearsome chili-induced sweat.
In addition to abalone-themed set meals and Sichuan-style high tea, the restaurant also features an expansive list of high end teas imported from various regions in China.

"Si Wei Mao Cai","It’s a no-brainer that our love for spicy foods knows no bounds. Whether it is a tucking into a bubbling pot of fish head curry, or scouring for the best sambal for our nasi lemak, we flock to spicy foods like moths to a flame. That’s why we’re head over heels for Si Wei Mao Cai, a humble Sichuan restaurant located in Chinatown that reigns supreme with its fiendishly spicy foods.

Ready to set your tongue ablaze? Then we highly recommend diving into a pot of Si Wei Stewed Beef in Hot Szechuan Pepper Sauce. Adventurous eaters should not miss the restaurant’s rendition of Si Wei Chilli Frog where tender frog legs are stir-fried in a blend of fresh and dried chillies. Then wash down the spiciness with the mild vinegary Pickled Vegetables with Beef, or any number of Chinese wines and liquors available here. If you ask us, we personally can’t say no to a cold glass of Hai Zi Lan or a Mao Tai.

Aside from its delectable dishes, Si Wei Mao Cai also prides itself on its top-notch service. And honestly, we’re bowled over not only by the incredibly polite and efficient wait staff, but the kitchen who tries to accommodate any requests for Sichuan dishes not on the menu.

With these successes and a combined market presence of more than 150 years, the partners have decided to showcase Singapore-style seafood cuisine through the establishment of Singapore Seafood Republic in Singapore at the iconic Resorts World Integrated Resort in October 2010.

Seared with the brilliance and mastery of four of Singapore’s best-loved seafood dining brands, the inaugural Singapore Seafood Republic outlet in Singapore will feature over 70 celebrated dishes that would encapsulate the island city’s rich heritage in seafood cuisine.

In March 2011, the fourth outlet (and the third for Japan) was opened at Uemeda, Osaka.

"Sinpopo","All dressed up in vintage furnishings, Sinpopo isn’t trying to be an elevated version of your local coffee shop. Although the flavours are inspired by the classic food stalls nearby, the fusion of heritage tastes with modern dining sets this spot apart.
Smartly decorated to feel like a throwback living room, you didn’t have to live through the 70s to recognize the look. Tapered leg tables, wide couches and a boxy TV set now used as a stand all contribute to a unique and trendy feel, making this a great choice for a casual dinner or lengthy weekend lunch.
The menu comes in the form of an old-school attendance roster, and you can choose from heavy-hitters that you might find familiar like Ma Ling Luncheon Crisps and spicy Sambal Fishballs. The signature dishes include the Har Jeong Burger with crispy prawn paste-crusted chicken sandwiched between soft buns. The Nasi Lemak for Two is a hearty platter of all your favourite fixings, plus a big helping of home made sambal that’s offered in free flow. The Gula Melaka Cake is the superstar dish that has diners flocking. A layered creation with smooth caramelized palm sugar, it’s coffee’s match made in heaven.

With a kitchen helmed by Chef Paul Hallet, diners are sure to come here for the views and stay for the excellent food.

The Uni Risotto is an excellent dish of buttery arborio rice cooked to fluffy perfection and served with a generous serving of Uni. The vibrant colour of the dish is easy on the eye, and the briny seafood taste cuts through the velvet butter of the dish, making for a delectable dish. The Angus Beef is another dish sure to be adored by meat and seafood lovers alike. Chunks of Angus beef are seared to gentle perfection in a pan before being served with carrots, spinach, and caviar - the buttery richness of the beef is offset by the salty flavour of the caviar, balancing the dish.
For those working in the area, the set lunch is not to be missed. After all, there are not many places that offer such great value with panoramic views of Marina Bay. (Jul 2019)

"Smokey's BBQ (Joo Chiat)","Unbeknownst to most Singaporeans, barbecue is a craft that requires passion, dedication, and practice. And at Smokey's BBQ, the down to earth, open air, go-to place for American-style ribs, that's exactly what you get. This isn't your simple poolside open brick pit with charcoal. In fact, Smokey's use a custom built smoker, imported wood from the States, and a homemade dry rub, all for that ultimate barbecue experience. Endorsed by our very own in-house token Texan, Smokey's BBQ is THE place to go for delicious ribs, beer, and an old-fashioned good time.
The homemade sauces complement the dishes perfectly, and when coupled with the rich smoky flavour of the meat, it's impossible to resist picking the bones clean. For the perfect barbecue experience though, you'll need to wash all that meat down with some ice cold beer! There's beer on tap, imported craft beers by the bottle, and even a selection of wines from the walk-in wine cellar. Suffice to say, you won't be leaving hungry or thirsty.
As one of the owners so eloquently said, the secret to Smokey's is simply that they love the food they serve, and serve the food they love.

Staying true to the restaurant’s namesake, Soufflé will serve more than a dozen varieties of French soufflés - all recipes that have been masterfully curated by Olivier. The restaurant’s delectable array of savoury and sweet options is set to bring guests a true taste of Paris and satiate any palate.

Suitable as large starters or smaller main course options, diners will be able to enjoy savoury soufflés in traditional French and modern flavours. Traditional options include the Comté Cheese Soufflé, the Roquefort Soufflé featuring the flavourful ‘The King of French Cheese’; and the luxurious Lobster Soufflé, chock-full of sweet lobster meat, as well as rich pour-over lobster bisque. To celebrate all things Singaporean, the menu also boasts the Laksa Soufflé ($26), made with fresh prawns and a flavourful pour-over laksa which captures the aroma and essence of one of Singapore’s most popular local dishes.


To accompany a meal of fluffy soufflés, the restaurant also serves heart-warming varieties of authentic French casseroles, fresh from the oven. Guests can enjoy a cooked-to-perfection Boeuf Bourguignon, a stew of slow-cooked beef cheeks in red wine and a garniture of bacon; a Parmentier de Canard, luscious shredded duck confit under a blanket of mashed potato and finished in the oven with butter parsley breadcrumbs; and for those who love the fresh flavours of the sea, ‘Local Catch’ Bouillabaisse, a classic Provençal-style stew loaded with fisherman’s catch seafood and served with crisp rouille toasts.


Guests will also be spoilt for choice by the selection of sweet soufflés, which can be enjoyed at any time of day or as the grand finale to any meal. Select sweet soufflés are available in individual, as well as sharing portions, making it easier to enjoy the sweet treats regardless of whether dining alone or with a group of friends. Diners will be able to enjoy the show-stopping classic French favourite of Grand Marnier et Oranges Confites Soufflé, which includes a generous dousing of the cognac and bitter orange liqueur; A la Chartreuse which features a splash of the popular French digestif, Chartreuse, made from over 100 plants and flowers; fruity flavours such as the Framboises et Glace Vanille, with the bright tanginess of raspberry paired with creamy vanilla bean ice cream; contemporary offerings such as the Speculoos Soufflé with speculoos-spiced cream; as well as tall, fluffy iced soufflés (or Soufflé Glace), such as the Citron Vert.

Imagine a chic, new-American style restaurant right off the streets of swish New York, except tucked away in a quiet residential neighbourhood in the East. Here, they grow their own herbs, make their own pasta, and build from scratch practically everything else that goes onto your plate. Kick off with their signature Chicken Noodle Soup, a deli classic here made with a super-rich chicken stock, shredded chicken breast, little chunks of fresh vegetables, and pasta noodles. Other appetizers include their stellar Poutine, easily one of the best on the island, featuring freshly-made fries slathered with a meaty duck-stock gravy, and melty cheese curd sauce.

It’s the mains here that will steal your heart, though, particularly their perfectly balanced pasta plates, featuring fresh handmade pasta. The Duck Confit Tagliatelle features delicate, eggy noodles in a meaty sauce of duck confit, hazelnut cream, and sauteed spinach, while the Gemelli Bolognese features little chewy batons of pasta coated in an unctuous, creamy ragu, topped with an indecent amount of tangy pecorino cheese. Also good is the Seared Prawn with Carrot Risotto, featuring flame-seared tiger prawns atop a savoury-sweet, flaming orange risotto, drizzled with fresh pesto.

Take the Traditional Carbonara, where a heap of spaghetti is tossed in a creamy and cheesy sauce. The dish is topped with chunks of pancetta, with the option to top up for additional prawns or bacon. The ‘Spagged Pastas’ on the menu are where the chefs here get creative, turning out interesting flavour combinations. Mummy’s Assam, for instance, is a juicy piece of fried dory fillet on pasta infused with a fiery sauce. The Golden Egg is a must-try for salted egg lovers, where crispy chicken nibbles are bathed in the rich golden sauce. Leave the diet at the door and come hungry!

"Spicy House","Buckle up and prepare for a rich, hearty, and – above all – spicy gastronomic adventure that has plenty of ‘kick’ and definitely won’t disappoint. Spicy House Restaurant certainly pulls no punches in serving quality, fiercely authentic, Chengdu-style hotpot. The chain has its origins in Shanghai and the outlet in Riverside Point is its first overseas branch; unique to the Singapore outlet is the mouthwatering addition of Japanese wagyu beef and Australian lobster (plus some others) to the menu.

The restaurant’s signature soup base is the Mala Butter, which has a distinctively rich flavour courtesy of the butter stirred into the soup. You’d be hard-pressed to forget the taste of this particular base, which possesses a complexity that not many other places can produce. If you’re looking for something different, however, you can choose from a list of soup bases such as Tomato, Pig’s Trotters, and Chestnut Healthy Chicken, among others. Some ready-to-eat side dishes include flavourful Sichuan Dumplings as well as Mala Noodles, for those who feel like having something apart from hotpot. It quickly becomes apparent that there’s something in this restaurant for everyone,  especially for those who like their food extra spicy, so make your way down to Spicy House Restaurant – you definitely won’t regret it!

"Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe","Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe was founded by homegrown businessman, Ron Poh, five years ago. 

It started with the passion of seeking real authentic Thai food. He has an unexplainable affinity with anything Thai, from culture to food. If you are one avid fan of Thai food, you’ll be happy that someone is doing it the real authentic way right here in the heart of Singapore; from using charcoal for soup and steamed dishes to maintain heat consistency and quality, importing tea leaves from Thailand for the signature Thai Iced Tea, different own-made dressings for different dishes, to desserts made from scratch, or even customised dishes. This is exactly the authenticity that Ron wants to bring across as the brand personality and offerings of Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe.

“Charcoal is the best tool to keep this dish simmering hot consistently without affecting the quality of the dish. Yes, it’s more hard work, but we think it’s worth it. We do not want our customers to be compromised, we want them to enjoy Thai food the authentic way”, said Ron, Founder & Owner of Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe. And precisely, this is what authentic cooking is all about.

If you are looking for a classic meal of Thai cuisine that delivers on taste and won’t break the bank, Spicy Thai-Thai Cafe is the right place for you. The cafe is decked out in a comfortable non-intimidating Thai decor, with ornate patterns, bouquets of flowers and ceiling fans whirling. The cafe looks out onto the lush greenery and a quaint garden. Savour authentic Thai cuisine with a laid-back atmosphere, and enjoy them so much that your taste buds sing!

"The Spiffy Dapper","A local area watering hole now sitting on Amoy Street (previously in Boat Quay), Spiffy Dapper is not your typical go-to bar by all means. It's spunky, edgy, and full of character. Think dive-bar meets retro speakeasy - meaning each visit will be full of surprises.
Featuring a theme that's part rustic, part industrial chic, it's the ideal spot to come grab happy hour during the week, or drown out all your worries on the weekends. While you're at it, we suggest grabbing some of their nibbles like the Salmon Ceviche or Butter Garlic Shrimp, before imbibing their specialty tipples like the Sheik on the Level, a handcrafted drink with potent gin, black Turkish tea, lemon juice, and freshly ground cardamom. For something a little sweeter, the Glad Rags Sheba is perfect. With cane sugar and cinnamon infused apples in every sip, this drink is the liquid equivalent of a carnival candied apple - so delicious!

About Executive Chef Lee Boon Seng

As a boy of 17 in the kitchen of Equinox watching culinary virtuosity in action, executive chef Lee Boon Seng found his
calling. He stayed for eight years at this - his first job, rising from trainee to Chef de Partie before notching an impressive resume at places like Curate and the one-starred Osia at Resorts World Sentosa.

Chef Lee was honored with multiple accolades including Rising Chef of the Year at the World Gourmet Summit of 2013, and the Overall Champion during the semi-finals of Global Chefs Challenge organized by the Paris-based World Association of Chefs Societies (WACS). He also earned the opportunity of hosting and working with numerous Michelin-starred veterans such as Massimiliano Alajmo of the three-starred Le Calandre in Padua, Italy; Guy Martin of the three-starred Le Grand Véfour in Paris, France; and Esben Holmboe Bang of the three-starred Maaemo in Oslo, Norway.

The food at The Spot is highly individualistic – with the starting point an ingredient that excites Chef Lee with the drive to introduce its beauty to the world by elevating its flavors. He found this route through sauces, employing the European techniques of his training in tandem with the Southeast Asian fruits, herbs, and spices of his cultural heritage.

"Spring Court","As the oldest family-run restaurant still in business, it’s clear that Spring Court Restaurant has more than proven its mettle, and then some. Opened in 1929, the establishment has seen more than one venue (think the well-known Great World Amusement Park), and today one can find it located in a beautifully preserved heritage shophouse along Upper Cross Street. A restaurant that has remained open for this long surely has something good going for it, and you certainly won’t regret a visit!

Lose yourself in the variety of sets offered on the menu. There’s a particular set for one person that we’re pretty fond of, with its plethora of seafood eats. Luxuriate in a serving of Stewed Boston Lobster in Fresh Fungus in Superior Stock, a tasty dish made with delightfully fresh helpings of lobster you’ll be remembering for days to come. The Crisp Fried Fillet of Cod Fish with BBQ Sauce is another dish that’s easy to love – perfectly crispy on the outside with firm, fresh cod on the inside, you’d be hard-pressed to stop yourself from guzzling it all down in a rush! There are other sets available that are pretty damn good too, and anyone who gets a taste of the restaurant’s comfort food offerings will immediately understand why it has remained open for business through the decades.

"Stateland Cafe","You approach a nondescript shophouse in Bugis only to see its interiors have been given a sleek industrial makeover: exposed cement walls, wooden tables, tungsten lamps. You settle down for what you think is going to be a generic cafe experience, but the sleek menu here, simple and understated, looks more like the catalogue of a chic boutique. Turns out the food is experimental takes on cafe classics and local favourites, made by a dedicated kitchen team in the second-storey “production kitchen”. Beautifully presented on white and blue china plates, the humble kong bak pau is renamed the Xi’An Burger and given the Momofuku treatment: it’s filled with braised beef, fried cumin-kissed potatoes, and fried eggs. The Japanese beef bowl is remade into a pillowy risotto dish with beef cheeks atop a mound of creamy, umami grains.
At its heart, though, Stateland is still a cafe-hopper’s dream. They’re famous for their line of innovative waffles and thick toasts, crispy-edged beds of sweet carbohydrates topped with ice cream and sauces. These aren’t run-of-the-mill numbers, though, the yeasted waffles are chewy and complex, and come flavoured with ingredients like matcha and charcoal for extra layers. The flavour combinations are winners. Think Red Velvet Waffles, S’mores-inspired waffles, and Hazelnut Praline Thick Toast - two desserts in one! The coffee here is made from a punchy blend of Guatemalan and Colombian beans to round off the third-wave cafe experience. Grab some pictures, nurse a coffee, and pig out on great food; brunch and lazy afternoons await at Stateland Cafe. (Nov 2016)

"Stellar at 1-Altitude","""Chef of the Year - Chef Christopher Millar"" and ""Most Romantic Restaurant"" - Chope's Diners' Choice Awards 2014

When you have Stellar at 1-Altitude's views, you could be dining in a cardboard box and you wouldn't notice. Perched on the 62nd floor of One Raffles Place, it's difficult not to appreciate the unparalleled views of our favourite city. Nonetheless, Stellar stays consistent with its theme of elevated dining with clean lines, crystalline accents and a cafe au lait palette.

The open kitchen is certainly not a novel concept, but with cathedral-height ceilings, this one seems more expansive than most. The dedication to perfection in each culinary art is impressive - sea-fresh oysters and other sustainable produce, house-cured charcuterie, and a melange of desserts are on rotation on the thoughtfully curated, seasonal menu by acclaimed Chef Christopher Millar and astounding pastry chef, Jasmin Chew.

Currently on offer is the Constellations Gastronomic Menu, at once both exquisite and approachable. Choose between 6 or 8 courses, or go for a more selective approach with the vegetarian option. Taste of Loch Fyne, Twice Baked Gruyere Soufflé, Otoro Risotto with Pancetta and Hazelnuts - these plates sound inviting and when presented, pleasantly surprise with their depth and creativity. The grand finale comes in the form of an actual dessert art performance by the pastry chef, tableside. 

Keep in mind that Stellar was one of the select few restaurants to be a Krug Ambassade and in 2017 became the first in Singapore to join vintage champagne house Dom Pérignon in embarking on the Ultimate Dom Pérignon Experience (Dom Pérignon Plénitudes Ultimate Experience).

This tight rope performance between delicious familiarity and unforeseen innovation is what Stellar at 1-Altitude is known for, and why it stands above the rest in terms of fine dining institutions in Singapore.

"Stirling Steaks @ 43 East Coast Road","There’s no lack of food choices along this bustling stretch in the East. But if you’re looking to sink your teeth into a slab of meat, then Stirling Steaks is hard to beat. The sliders are a good sign of what to expect from the mains — $3 a pop gets you juicy mini patties sandwiched between fluffy buns with a slice of tomato. There are off-cuts like flank steak on the menu, but the stars of the show here are definitely the Ribeye and Sirloin steaks. The slabs of beef are grilled over charcoal, which gives the meat a delicious smoke-kissed aroma. On top, a safe choice of herb butter or adventurous pickings like avocado butter — the latter melts over the juicy steak and adds a rich, creamy flavour to the beef. Best paired with crispy, golden truffle fries. (Oct 2018)

"Suage (Capitol Piazza)","Hokkaido might be famous for its snow-capped mountains and tranquil lakes, but it’s also a rich culinary hotspot that has created some of the best Japanese dishes we’ve all grown to love. Now, from the northern island of Japan comes Suage, a vibrant and casual eatery specialising in bubbling pots of Hokkaido soup curry.

Located on the premises of Capitol Piazza, Suage churns up bowls of soup curries unlike any other. The menu here is simple and straightforward. Pick a protein and the skilled chefs will cook it in a fragrant curry broth alongside an assortment of vegetables and rice. Some sure-fire hits include the Chicken “Kushiyaki” set, which features chunks of grilled chicken, as well as the Beef “Shabu–Shabu” set which uses perfectly sliced cuts of beef that will melt in your mouth. Unlike other establishments, vegetarian dishes here aren’t an afterthought, as Suage has managed to create a number of meatless options that are as tasty as they are healthy. We love the For Vegetarian set that’s a nutritious meal featuring a special curry soup brimming with beans and other vegetables.

Whether you’re seeking a quick meal, an affordable dinner option, or just a comforting bowl of Japanese curry, why not give Suage a go? (Jul 2018) ","Japanese","Mon-Sun: 11:30am-3pm, 5:30-10pm","Business Meetings, Casual Dining","13 Stamford Road#B2-53Capitol PiazzaSingapore (178905)","$$"

With Bento sets, tempura, and sushi on the menu, this eatery serves up almost every Japanese classic you can think of, at a ridiculously affordable price point. Don’t let the prices here deceive you, however, as these dishes are nothing to scoff at.

Start with the Tsukune, grilled chicken meatballs -minced chicken flavoured with traditional Japanese spices and grilled to perfection. Diners looking for something a little lighter can opt for the Daikon Salad - white radish salad topped with silverfish. The sweet crunch of the root vegetable contrasts perfectly with the briny taste of the fish.

The Katsuni is a meaty dish made of pork cutlet and egg and topped with seaweed. Vegetarians can opt for the Yamaimo To Natto, which features the Japanese delicacy of fermented beans cooked with chewy glutinous yam. The earthy flavour of the beans blends perfectly with the tender softness of the glutinous yam. Seafood lovers can opt for the Kawaebi - deep-fried cherry shrimps cooked still in shell. The tenderness of the flesh contrasts perfectly with the crunch of the shell it is encased by. With beautiful dishes and a cosy setting, you’ll find yourself popping by again and again. (Jun 2018)

"Sumire Yakitori House","Taking the pride of place in the cosy Japanese space that is Sumire Yakitori House at Bugis Junction is, of course, a grill. Large and shiny, it produces skewer after skewer of succulent meat grilled expertly right in front of you. Sumire hails from a long tradition of yakitori in Japan, and this is clear in its extensive menu, which showcases different parts of the humble chicken, from its shoulder to its thigh. Sumire’s meatballs are very popular for their savory balance of juicy flavours. They literally explode their goodness with each bite, making it necessary for you to reach out for a napkin or two to dab your mouth with after each bite.

Non-yakitori items are also available at Sumire. The Japanese Daisen Chicken Hotpot is made from Daisen chicken, a breed of chicken that has been raised on the Daisen mountain in Tottori Prefecture (north of Kyoto) in Japan. The stock itself is chock-full of goodness, with chicken meat, minced chicken balls, prawn, fried tofu, enoki mushrooms, okra, zucchini, and fungus all contributing to its robust and hearty flavour.

Love runny eggs? The D-I-Y Tamago Toji Hotplate is the perfect dish for you. Tossed in the hotplate are grilled chicken meat, grilled chicken meatballs, and mixed mushrooms, all mixed in a savoury-sweet dashi. Unlike the usual Tamago Toji dishes, Sumire serves the raw pasteurized egg separately so you can decide how cooked you want your egg to be. Do not ignore the accompanying rice bowl topped with Egg Tempura. The yolk itself is comfortingly runny, and together with the chicken pieces hidden in the rice, it is an eggy party in the mouth. For a yakitori night out that is far from yucky, Sumire is the place for you.

"Summer Hill","Anthony Yeoh and Christopher Soh, the folks behind the now-defunct and dearly missed French bistro Cocotte, come together again to bring you Summer Hill, offering French classics in their inimitable laid back fashion, except in scaled down, but very cozy Clementi digs. It’s an intimate space but even then the kitchen is an open-concept one, so you can see the chefs hard at work turning out your roast chooks and other delights in a manner not unlike watching your grandma potter away in the kitchen. You’ll want to make a booking because this tiny hole in the wall has only one indoor table with a small alfresco section, and even then these chefs have a cult following who’ll gamely brave muggy weather for some French perfection.

You’ll know once you walk in what the specialty is: that warm thyme and butter scent, and the familiar fragrance of perfectly crisp, browned skin can only mean exquisite French-style roast chicken. A hormone and antibiotic free bird is given a good roast after being slathered with creamy, herb-scented butter for extra crispiness and flavour. It comes accompanied with roasted sprouts and spuds, plus a gravy-boat of jus, liquid gold that elevates this to high gourmand territory. Besides chicken, think other French bistro classics like a formidable, Gruyère encrusted Croque Monsieur, other roasted meats like a beautiful Sage & Mustard Roasted Kurobuta Pork Collar, and the king of all grilled joints, the Premium Roast Prime Rib Steak, a family-sized cut of Angus beef. It’s not the biggest menu, but that just means they give a lot more love and attention to each plate, which, if you ask us, is perfect. (Mar 2018)

You even get a choice of what cheese to put in your burger! Wash the meal down with a local craft beer, which comes with fun names like Tok Gong (an ale malt flavoured booze with a hint of citrus) and Si Bei Ho, a very good beer made from traditional Belgian yeast, curacao orange peel, and coriander.

"Sushi Mieda","If there's one thing the Chope team strives to avoid when it comes to describing a restaurant, it's hollow superlatives. With that said, a meal at Sushi Mieda is nothing short of breathtaking. Though what's served will change depending on what's in season in Japan at the current moment, you can be rest assured that everything will be prepared with craft and precision, earning Sushi Mieda a place among the upper crust of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore.
For our meal, we were welcomed with a starter of sea urchin atop sesame tofu, covered in a bonito-broth jelly, and garnished with a touch of caviar and gold leaf. Describing the combination of flavours and textures as a symphony probably doesn't do it justice; the balance of saltiness from the bonito jelly and sweetness from the sea urchin and sesame tofu meant it was more a masterpiece than any 'mere' composition.
Course after course convinced us that we were dining in the presence of a master craftsman. Head Chef Keisuke Ohno treated us to a dazzling array of fish both expected and uncommon. For the less sushi-seasoned, opportunities to sample fishes like golden-eyed snapper and black-throat perch will open your mind to an ocean far beyond salmon, tuna, and flounder.
The setting for this culinary master class is equally authentic. Seats at the sushi counter of eight make for an intimate dining experience, its position at the centre of the floor just emphasizing the exclusivity, while sitting at the ""outside"" tables lining the interior of the tower provide for spectacular views of the surrounding area.
Quite frankly, any meal at Sushi Mieda lets you leave the trappings of Collyer Quay far behind. An effortlessly bona fide Japanese experience, don't be surprised if you stumble back out, sated and blissful, and find yourself disorientated by the realization that you aren't standing on a street in Ginza.

"Swensen's (Changi Airport T2)","The name Swensen’s is deeply entrenched in many a Singaporean childhood memory for its ice cream and, in recent years, this experience has widened to include casual, affordable Western meals. From steak to chicken to baked desserts, the Swensen's menu is wide-ranging and able to please the taste buds of the most finicky of eaters.
In the constantly evolving menu, Swensen's strives to stay at the top of its game by offering its version of trending food items. Salted Egg Lava Rolls is one such dish. Charcoal bread rolls arrive at the table oozing with salted egg butter cream. If this isn't enough decadence, it also comes paired with buttered potatoes and cheesy sausages on the side. Calories aside, the mix of flavours is simply impeccable with the charcoal bread offering a good balance to all that richness. Another version of a fashionable dish is Chicken N Waffle. A spin on classic Southern chicken and waffles, it comes drizzled with butter lime sauce. Again, to ramp up the love, it's served with buttered potatoes, creamy mushrooms, and cheesy sausages.
From the ice cream selection, popular classics such as Sticky Chewy Chocolate and Rocky Road are now bedfellows with more distinctly local flavours such as Coconut Yam and Salted Egg Yolk. For a really local taste, try the Yummy Sticky Coco Yam sundae, which features generous scoops of creamy coconut yam ice cream layered with fragrant Thai sticky rice, red beans, coconut bits, and fresh coconut milk. It's a wild party in the mouth that will leave you satisfied, which can be said about many of the dishes on the menu. It certainly looks like those great memories of Swensen's are set to continue.

"Syun","Singapore’s Japanese dining scene is vibrant, and has had plenty of new restaurants popping up every so often, but few offer the fresh take on seasonal dining that Syun does. Located in the luxe Crockfords Tower of Resorts World Sentosa, this spot pays homage to Japanese fine dining with their refreshing interpretations of classics. A sleek interior boasts natural accents like wood and marble and makes the perfect spot for a business lunch to impress, or even a date night to impress.

For a dish that is as delicious as it is Instagram-worthy, try the Sea Urchin Rolled by Wagyu Beef. Served on little gold spoons, this delight is made with the beloved Japanese uni rolled up in a thin strip of raw beef. Elegant and simple, it is the perfect way to prime your palate for the flavours to come. The Wagyu Beef Sukiyaki is a premium plate that is a must-try for meat lovers. Made with thin strips of premium meat cooked at the table, the beef absorbs the flavours of the broth and is so tender, it falls off the fork. Kurobuta Pork and Wagyu Beef Shabu-Shabu are also available for diners to enjoy at their tables.

"Tabbouleh @ Arab Street","The flavors of the Middle East come alive at Tabbouleh @ Arab Street, a cozy little eatery located along Arab Street. With an emphasis on quality ingredients such as fresh produce and authentic ingredients imported from overseas, this restaurant consistently spin outs plates of mouthwatering food. So it’s no surprise why the Middle Eastern powerhouse stands heads and shoulders above the rest of the competition in the Kampong Glam neighborhood and is filled with hungry diners at every service.

People in the Middle East are often known for showing their grand hospitality through their food and Tabbouleh @ Arab Street is no exception. While we may be miles away from the region, the warm hospitality is still strikingly apparent, from the attentive service to the convivial atmosphere fostered.

We love nothing more than kicking off the meal with a warm bowl of Lentil Soup that’s not only scrumptious but nourishing to boot. Then tuck into the homemade Hummus dip or the warm Falafel balls. As for mains, the Lamb Chops can’t be beaten. Marinated in an Egyptian herb blend, these lollipop sticks of lamb are then chargrilled and paired with a complementary harissa sauce.

If you love classic Turkish and Middle Eastern food, then Tabbouleh @ Arab Street is the place to be. (Dec 2018)","Middle Eastern, Vegetarian Friendly","Mon-Sun: 11am-11pm","Al Fresco, Business Meetings, Casual Dining, Quiet Dinner, Large Parties (16+)","41 Arab StreetSingapore (199740)","$$"

"Table Restaurant and Bar","A casual, more gastronomically adventurous spinoff of the timeless and classic Indian restaurant, Rang Mahal, this is located in a super chic boutique hotel along trendy Seah Street. Walking in, everything about the space, from its hip soundtrack to the edgy modern decor, announces the restaurant’s intentions to serve up classic Indian food with a contemporary, mostly vegetarian edge, in a relaxed bistro-style environment. A plus point is that the food here is determined to be lighter and healthier than classic Indian cuisine, but with all of its rich flavours held intact.
Drop by during lunch, for instance, and you’ll be treated to a full Indian meal of Palak Paneer and Murgh Angar elegantly served in a “bento box,” and you might be tempted by the staff to end your meal with a popsicle of fresh raspberry, coconut, and chia seeds. But those seeking true Indian flavours will be more than satisfied with capably-made classics like a delicious Chicken Tikka marinated in a tart yoghurt and chili dressing before being gently charred on a tandoor, a spicy Bengali Fish Masala bursting with the bright flavours of mustard seed and spices, or a Tandoor Paneer Tika, cubes of buttery cottage cheese given the barbecue treatment. Contemporary Indian food with a gently experimental hand and a classic sensibility, in sophisticated and elegant surroundings, this is a surprise downtown getaway from the busy city centre.

"Tajimaya Yakiniku","Yakiniku is one of the great pillars of Japanese cuisine: the practice of grilling succulent cuts of meat over a charcoal fire. The basic elements are almost religious in their simplicity: beautifully marbled and fresh meat, a smoky fire, and some subtle dipping sauces to go along. Oh, and bowlfuls of steaming hot rice on which to baste those hot, meaty drippings.

Here at Tajimaya, the menu is basically page after page of different grades of top-grade meat, though really they are most famous for their offerings of divine Miyazaki Beef offered in a range of cuts from ribeye to chuck short rib. Choose from an à la carte menu or simply get the set, which comes with a generous lineup of sides from crunchy Tempura to a daily selection of Sashimi, as well as a comforting bowl of Garlic Fried Rice. Apart from Miyazaki beef, there is US Wagyu and US Angus, as well as fatty Kurobuta Pork for lovers of that other great barbecue meat. The pork is available in a range of cuts as well, including the unctuous jowl cut, or meltingly tender cheek that will reduce to a fatty sliver of joy in your mouth.

To undercut all of that meaty goodness, other dishes here include Korean-inspired soups like Kimchi Soup and hot-stone Ishiyaki Dons filled with meat and vegetables crackling from the heat of the bowl. To fill up, slurp up some piping hot Udon. With meat this good, you’ll want very little else but rice, but these other options make this restaurant perfect for hitting every corner of that Japanese craving you’ve been nursing. (Jan 2018)

Tender Norwegian salmon is served like you’ve never had it before: dressed in sweet and sour Nam Jin Sauce. That old hawker centre classic, grilled stingray, comes to the table with lashings of tamarind relish. Not to be outdone, French lobster bisque gets the hot and tangy tom yum treatment. It’s not just seafood. Pork and chicken dishes get similar Thai makeovers, and there’s plenty of classics like Phad Thai and various Thai curries to sate your Thai craving.

At Tamashii along North Canal Road, that’s precisely what you get. An elegant blend of tradition and panache, food is served on wooden oars in homage to Japanese fishermen who did the same once upon a time.
The freshest ingredients are flown in regularly from Japan, and Chef Patrick Tan continuously goes out of his way to prepare the amazing produce in tantalising, and occasionally fascinating ways! Previous seasonal stunners include grilled squid lips, ivory shell sashmi (called Shiro Baigai in Japanese), and Japanese clams served in a variety of ways.
You can’t go to a Japanese robataya without having some grilled fish though, and the seasonal Barracuda was grilled to perfection. The skin of the fish was crispy, the flesh moist and tender. It tasted of the grill and the sea, and felt like a portal to being seated on the beach, charcoal in the sand, and fish straight from the ocean.
We love the idea of walking into your favourite restaurant and eagerly asking “what’s in season right now?” Whether it’s the fruit of the land or the fruits of the ocean, there’s definitely only the freshest ‘fruit’ on offer at Tamashii, and we’re always eager to be introduced to something new, delicious, and satisfying whenever we visit.

Think Tahu Telur, a beautiful block of tender egg tofu encased in fried egg and then drenched in a savoury-sweet soy sauce gravy and topped with nuts and crunchy shallots. The signature here is the classic Rendang Lembu, a fastidiously slow-braised rendang made from beef in a house spice blend and lots of rich coconut milk, reduced until richly caramelized and fork-tender.
They’re especially famous for their Satay, featuring tender skewered chicken and fatty beef cooked over a charcoal flame and served up with a traditional peanut sauce, as well as the Cumi Cumi Goreng, crispy baby squid in a dark sweet sauce.

We believe dining out should be a fun experience, serving up dishes that make you amused, inquisitive, and most of all happy. We love everything Japanese, but we also love that no-holds-barred American street food, so we put them together for creations that are unique and unbelievably flavorful.

Here, don’t expect your usual lines of sushi and sashimi, you’re getting a full-on modern American take on Japanese flavours. Think a Duck Confit Herumetto, featuring pulled duck confit, tomatoes, onions, avocado stuffed into seaweed taco shells. Or its cousin, the Negitoro Herumetto, the same seaweed taco shells stuffed with chopped fatty tuna. Take that, California maki. These people are most famous for popularising the low-cost Truffle Yakiniku Donburi, a heady bowl of sushi rice topped with strips of seared Angus short rib, doused in truffle sauce, and crowned with a wobbly onsen egg and shavings of fresh truffle. If you really want to push it, add a lobe of grilled foie gras, because why not?

To be honest, that’s not even really pushing the limits. Infusing Japanese-American cuisine with some cheeky Singaporean flair, they’ve also got the Salted Duck Egg Char Siew Donburi, a mischievous mouthful that actually works: the char siew is made from impossibly tender Nagano pork belly, which is coated in a creamy salted duck egg hollandaise, and topped with mushrooms and an onsen egg. It’s like brunch in a bowl, Singapore style. Of course, it wouldn’t be Tanuki Raw without its signature daily raw bar, which was the brand’s initial claim to fame. It’s a super-affordable selection of raw oysters, freshly shucked for your delectation, and perfect with a frosty sake. All this goodness under one roof? Better believe it.

"Tarte by Cheryl Koh","In 2015, Tarte by Cheryl Koh took Singapore by storm when they open their first retail shop at Shaw Centre. Helmed by Cheryl Koh, a Singaporean chef who was crowned 'Asia's Best Pastry Chef' by the Asia's 50 Best Restaurants Award, Tarte has since made a name for itself in Singapore and the rest of the region.

The various artisanal tarts and other confectioneries on offer are baked from scratch every morning with only the best available ingredients sourced from around the world. Many of these ingredients are highly sought-after and rarely served in Singapore. This is because when it comes to desserts, very few chefs in Singapore are willing to invest in seasonal fruit. Cheryl, however, is not one to compromise on quality.

"Tatsu (Asia Square)","Showcasing a contemporary blend of sushi and teppanyaki, Tatsu in Asia Square spares no expense in ensuring characteristic Japanese quality, with fish strictly air-flown for utmost freshness. Located on the second level of Asia Square Tower 2, the sleek decor and finishings reflect updated Japanese sensibility.
If you love the deliberate attention to detail of Japanese cuisine, take note of your surrounding here. From ingredients to presentation, every aspect that arrives to the table comes with a purpose. The flowers are not only for aesthetics, but are meant to complement the saltiness of your shoyu sauce with light floral and citrus scents.
Launch the sensory experience with the Pidan (Century Egg) Tofu. The silky homemade tofu is lathered with creamy century egg sauce that melts in your mouth. This winning combination, topped off with crunchy roe, leaves you craving more. The Omakase Sashimi platter, with Toro, Kanpachi, Shake, Amaebi and Shiro Maguro, was so fresh that even a novice could identify its superiority to mundane fish. The highlight had to be the Shiro Maguro marinated in soy though, which was delightfully chewy on the inside.
For cooked dishes, do check out the Imo Faogura (Tempura Yam with Foie Gras) and Utsuwa Ebi (Crayfish). The crunch of the tempura battered yam contrasted smartly with the creamy foie gras. The crayfish, accompanied with fried garlic flakes and tossed in chili oil, was succulent to the bite. With clean flavours and a strong intention motivating each aspect of the restaurant, Tatsu is a winner.

Once inside, the Swiss chalet inspiration is clear – wood panels, vintage-looking lamps, and other decorative knick-knacks give the small space cosy warmth.
The philosophy here is obviously less about fancy touches and more about letting the food speak for itself. None of that half-baked tourist fare though, the menu offers a rich selection of prime Continental items. Fresh Irish Oysters, Goose-Liver Terrine, Raclette Cheese with Air Dried Beef; you’d never guess these sumptuous appetisers were on offer just by looking at The Tavern Restaurant’s humble exterior. The mains are equally decadent, with Wagyu beef listed alongside dishes like Dingley Dell Pork Chop, Angel Hair Pasta with Half a Lobster, Sliced Veal Zurich, and Alaskan Crab-Mornay.

Based in Changi Village, this storied culinary establishment that was formerly based on Pulau Tekong has been wowing diners with its consistently fresh seafood and Chinese cuisine for over thirty-five years and counting.
Here, freshness is practically guaranteed as the restaurant tends to use live seafood that has been recently caught by local fishermen off the Singapore coast. And there’s something for everyone. For the health-conscious eaters, the Nyonya Steamed Fish is a great catch – bursting with flavour without the use of any oil. Meanwhile, the Ginger and Spring Onion Lobster is cleverly done, with the bright notes from ginger enhancing the tender lobster flesh. Vegetarians don’t have to despair, as the restaurant has plenty of stellar options to pick from, whether it is the soft Thai Style Tofu, or the crunchy Fried French Beans.

A gourmand’s dream, The Unatendon features tender eel nestled between a king prawn, bacon tempura, and an assortment of Japanese vegetables. What makes this dish so special, you ask?

TEN means “heaven” or “celebration” in Japanese and in the case of TEN Sushi, this can’t be more true: the cosy enclave is little more than a year old but has made its own splash with Sushi Master Marusaya at its helm. So whether you are looking for a mouthwatering array of fresh fish air-flown from Japan, impeccable hand-rolls, or just a comfy bowl of Don, TEN Sushi has got you more than covered.
The Salmon Tartar provides an enticing sneak peek into the exhilarating epicurean journey ahead. A generous portion of salmon cubes is masterfully drizzled with a tangy spicy sauce that does not mask the salmon’s delightful creaminess, while the runny goodness of a perfectly poached onsen egg elevates the entire appetizer. Jumping right into mains, the sushi steals the show with its sheer freshness. Don’t believe us? Try the delicate 3 Kinds of Blue Fin Tuna Sushi for yourself. The rolls don’t disappoint either - the Fisherman Inside-Out-Roll, for instance, features 10 types of fresh fish, totally changing the game for your usual hand roll.
Another highlight: the wide selection of sake, whiskey, and beers imported from Japan, so be sure to ask your friendly staff to recommend the perfect accomplice to a great meal!

An award-winning restaurant that has been passed down for three generations of Teochew chefs, Huat Kee is known and loved for its preservation of heritage Teochew flavours, but also its confidence in working with ingredients from far-flung places like Chile and South Africa. Enter the abalone, one of the signature ingredients at this restaurant, and some say done to perfection here. Served braised with sea cucumber, it may not taste like much, but it’s days in the making, and when eaten, is pillowy, soft, and bursting with briny goodness.

Like any it-girl, or it-restaurant for that matter, Tess has a distinctive style, swagger and can back it all up with bona fide coolness. That confidence comes from tatted-up head chef Martin Wong, with L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon kitchen cred and whose expertise in fine dining and playful personality comes through in a variety of small, medium and large plates, which vary in fanciness, but all aim to satisfy.
Behind the bar, you can find the shaken-up creations of Steve Leong, the well-known finalist of Diageo Reserve World Class' Singapore 2013. That means that the cocktails are as fine as the dining at Tess, whether you go with old world classics or newfangled tipples. He's not alone in dreaming up drinks, however, as Tess plays host to the city's up and comers in the bar scene, in what turns out to be an open mic night of sorts, that the regular patrons, and there are a lot of them, love.
Settle into the hip, glowy space that's configured for optimal hanging out. From the menu, the Duet Scallop & Aburi Tartare shows off Tess' fancier side, with scorched meaty scallops played against a refreshing chopped tartare. Also from the small plates, the Crispy Pork Belly is simplistic in its flavour, served with a fusion dip, forming a savoury, finger-licking good dish. From the Medium Plates, the Tess Wagyu Cubes & Bone Marrow is a surefire winner, with pan seared cuts of beef glazed with veal jus and marrow, just in case you needed more of a meat hit.
It's not all about the carnivores, though, as a selection of cheeses and even Vegan mains (a rare sight at Singapore fine dining restaurants, let alone a bar) can satisfy meatless diners. From that section, the Bohemian Vegetables Love is a colourful tangle of grilled zucchini, capsicum, aubergine and a piquant red pepper coulis. Finally, from the limited selection of dessert, the Chocolate Fondant with Blueberry Compote shows that the kitchen keeps careful measure of foodie trends, with savoury elements of spicy apple crumble accenting the luscious classic cake.
In the end, it's not just the good looks and impressive resume at Tess that will have you coming back for more, but the rotating food and drinks menu of creative selections. In fact, you are sure to learn what other fans already know: when it comes to Tess, just say yes.

This refreshing salad will awaken your taste-buds and prep your tongue for the onslaught of flavours to come. While classics like Tom Yam Goong, Gaeng Keow, and Gaeng Ped are available, the main that truly stands out is Prow Pla Nam Daeng, a hearty soup made with generous chunks of fish maw.

Looking for something a little moreish? Look no further than the Khao Ohb Sapparod - pineapple fried rice served with juicy chicken pieces and topped with sweet and salty pork floss. The tangy taste of the pineapple gives this dish a fresh tropical twist, while the flavoured pieces of chicken and vegetables add texture and complex flavours to what would otherwise be a regular plate of fried rice.

"Thus Coffee","If you’ve only ever been down Upper Thomson Road for the pratas, you’re missing out on the treasure trove of little indie bakeries, cafes, and restaurants tucked away in the small streets along the stretch. Thus Coffee is one of them, a specialty coffee joint in a charming residential area along Jalan Kuras, just a couple of minutes away from the Lower Peirce Reservoir Park. The space isn’t massive, but it’s very chic, done up with handsome wooden touches and a brushed concrete floor that announces its serious-coffee intentions. They’ve got an in-house roast and blend that they use for their coffees which promises a robust pick-me-up, but beyond a cuppa the food here is also to die for. Think subtle variations on the all-day breakfast menu, including treats like their in-house breakfast plate that features sous vide eggs on a fluffy muffin, paired with apple cider sausage, back bacon, mushrooms, and baked beans. Or the Salmon & Kale Toast, a fluffy brioche toastie topped with smoked salmon and avocado, creamy eggs, and a spinach and feta salad.

Lunch plates here take a heartier turn, with numbers like the Korean-inspired Chicken Cutlet Jyolmeon, chewy Gochujang-drenched noodles topped with a crispy chicken cutlet and sunny side up egg. The pasta here isn’t your garden variety stuff either, with punchy plates like the Linguine Puttanesca, bursting with ripe olives, piquant capers, chunky tomatoes, and briny anchovies. No self-respecting millennial outfit is complete with a grain bowl, and here the Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl takes pride of place, featuring tender beef atop a mélange of pearl barley and quinoa for some good artery-clearing health benefits and lots of toothsome flavour. Come for the mid-day coffee but stay for the mid-day snack and maybe dinner at this charming, Instagram-worthy haunt in one of Singapore’s most idyllic little neighbourhoods. (Feb 2018)

"Thyme @Aliwal","This cosy little spot is the perfect getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. From the beautiful art on the walls to the homely dishes on the menu, everything about this spot is comforting, making it the perfect place to unwind after a long day.

The menu items here are healthy dishes meant to feed the stomach and soul. The Asian Prawn & Quinoa Salad is a light dish of spiced shrimp tossed with avocado, greens, tomatoes, and cucumbers, and sprinkled with quinoa pearls. The tender shrimp and crisp greens make for a great texture combination, and the cucumber and tomatoes give the dish a fresh flavour that is hard to pass up. Diners after something more than a salad will enjoy the Salmon & Kale Stir Fry. Made with a generous serving of salmon tossed in kale with chilli and garlic, this dish is simple, spicy, and delicious.

For something a little heartier, opt for the Chorizo & Kale Broth. A rich stew of spiced Italian sausage, sprigs of kale, and juicy tomatoes, this is the perfect pick-me-up on a cold day, and is best enjoyed warm. The ever-popular burger is a crowd favourite, and for good reason. Made with a juicy meat patty and thick cut fries, this dish will satisfy all your cravings.

For your grain bowl fix, try the Quinoa with Roasted Pumpkin, a lovely contrast of buttery pumpkin against the toasty, popped-rice texture of quinoa. For a super indulgent salad, get the Grilled Prawns with House Made Chili Dip, featuring large tiger prawns grilled to perfection, served atop a bed of greens, waiting to be dipped into a piquant chili dip, really giving the old fashioned prawn cocktail a run for its money. Whatever your needs, there’s something for you at Thyme: allow yourself to settle down, grab a beer, and chill in one of the island’s great escapes.

The brightly lit interior and classic brick wall decor of Tino’s Pizza Cafe at The Centrepoint brings us back to our childhood days of dining in traditional pizza diners. Having enjoyed great success in Malaysia, they have now started their first overseas outlet at Sentosa. At Tino’s Pizza Cafe, their pizza is cooked the good ol' fashioned way by hand and oven baked. Diners can choose between two equally satisfying options - either the Neapolitan-style crust with a stretchy chew or the Roman-style crispy crust.

Not only do they know how to work a crust, their ingredients are generous and work harmoniously together. The staffs’ favourite, Pezzi Beef, is loaded with savoury beef chunks, topped with fresh herbs, shredded onions, and cabbage. Their dessert pizzas are cutely shaped like stars and the ingredients hint at the restaurant’s Asian roots. The Spica Crustar is a pizza interpretation of the popular bubble tea in Asia, where the crust holds a milk tea mousse filling and chewy tapioca pearls, with a mixture of fruits and drizzled with condensed milk. Gather up your families and friends and head over to Tino’s Pizza Cafe to taste the recipes that have fans in Malaysia going back again and again. (Jul 2018)

"Tipo","Named after the flour that is used to make their delicious pasta, Tipo is a world-class Italian spot created out of and dedicated to the love of pasta. All their noodles are made fresh in-house, and the “build your own bowl” concept of this restaurant means that no two visits here will be the same. Artisan ingredients, handcrafted menu items, and a close attention to detail means that dining at Tipo is is a premium experience to be savoured.

Make your own main dish here, with the option of a large or small portion. Fettuccine, fusilli, and spaghetti noodles are on offer. There is also a range of sauces, such as Aglio Olio, Roasted Red Pepper, and Carbonara available. The toppings on offer range from regular to premium, and consist of items like black caviar, sous vide egg, and black truffle paste.

 The pasta might be the highlight of the menu, but that doesn’t mean that the sweet treats are not as remarkable. The Espresso Panna Cotta is a delicious take on the classic sweet cream dessert, and the addition of coffee gives this dish a richer flavour that is the perfect way to end off a hearty meal.

"Tsuta Japanese Soba Noodles (Tai Seng)","Tsuta by Yuki Onishi
Driven by his ambitious desire to create truly original flavours, Chef Yuki Onishi sought to redefine the classic Ramen experience; without any artificial components or MSG. Taking creative inspiration from premium, natural ingredients, he created World’s First Michelin-starred Ramen eatery – Tsuta.
Menu Philosophy
A great deal of effort goes into engineering a bowl of Tsuta ramen. A combination of Chef Yuki Onishi's unique Dashi (""Soup Broth""), oils and sauces come together to create a delicate, multi-layered umami flavour burst.
Chef Yuki never believes in shortcuts. With meticulous culinary techniques and premium sourced ingredients, he creates savoury, inventive flavours that need no MSG or artificial flavouring. The taste and texture of each dish are constantly fine-tuned and revised by the chef himself.
There is no perfect bowl of ramen. Only a delicacy that’s constantly more delicious than before.
Birth of Tsuta
Chef Yuki Onishi came from a family of ramen chefs. His father owned a ramen shop called ‘Nanae no Aji no mise, Mejiro’. While Yuki did apprentice for his father after high school, he felt that he wanted more worldly exposure. He left the shop for the luxurious world of fashion where he became a merchandiser.
It was during his travels where he found a shocking contrast in food culture. Foreign dishes were often paired with sauces while in Japan, there is a strong culture of using dashi (soup stock) and a strong focus on umami. Inspired by this epiphany, he returned to the kitchen of his fathers’ ramen shop.
Following his predecessor’s philosophy of only using natural ingredients, Chef Yuki eventually developed his own original ramen dishes.

With an elegant interior, central location, and innovative cuisine, this restaurant is perfect for fun dinners with family, or a hearty catch-up session with friends.

Much of the focus of the menu here is on dishes containing beef. The Aburi Gyu Sushi is a crowd favourite, and for good reason. The dish consists of torched beef on a bed of steamed rice topped with bonito flakes that cause both ingredients to bind together. The meat is tender, and the thin strips make them almost melt in your mouth. The wasabi that accompanies the dish provides an additional depth of flavour, giving the dish a sharpness that will leave you craving more.

Another innovative dish on the menu is the Pesto Genovese Scallop Mushroom Gen Udon. Made with traditional pesto sauce and udon noodles, this dish presents a fusion of Japanese and Italian cuisine, and the grilled button mushrooms and baby scallops that top the dish add smokiness and richness to an already mouthwatering dish.

Famed for their expert grilling techniques and secret in-house sauces, this unagi restaurant is a must-visit for diners who love fine Japanese dining.

The latter two dishes are unique to the Singaporean incarnation of the restaurant, while the former is a signature dish available at all outlets. The unagi for all three dishes is marinated in a spice mixture made with ingredients directly imported from Tokyo before being steamed, then subsequently grilled - just as they do at all outlets across Japan.

To make your uni go a little further, have it as one of a selection of sashimi atop a bowl of rice in the restaurant’s hefty Bara Chirashi. But perhaps the most classic and delicious way to serve it up is in the hearty Ikura Uni Chirashi, which features mounds of salty salmon roe and uni atop rice, just mouthful after mouthful of pure, umami magic.

"Urbana Rooftop Bar","Novena is one of the most underrated downtown spots on the island, mixing a quiet neighbourhood vibe with access to great food and nightlife options, with none of the over-crowdedness of trendier areas. Urbana is the latest addition to this constellation of fun things to do here, an open-air bar at the top of the Courtyard Hotel by the Marriott group. It’s framed by a beautiful infinity pool that overlooks central Singapore, with a stunning view of a nearby nature reserve for a truly picturesque night out. It’s the only rooftop bar in Novena, which alone would be a reason to turn up, but they’ve put a great deal of care into the menu of gourmet bar bites, elegant plates, and cocktails.

Chow down on gourmet bar snacks like the juicy Wagyu Beef Sliders and moreish Blue Swimmer Crab Cakes, made with premium ingredients and bursting with flavour. Heftier snacks here include the mouthwatering Curry Nachos, crunchy corn tortillas slathered with homemade chicken curry, and served up with punchy salsa and crispy papadums. There’s also Pork & Pineapple Satay, another local touch featuring tender grilled pork skewers served with the customary peanut sauce, chunks of torched pineapple, and tangy pickled onions. Whatever the case, these small plates are the perfect foil to the strong cocktails on offer here, mixed up by dedicated mixologists. Whether it’s a refreshing Mojito or a bracing James Bond style Vesper, these classic cocktails will send you off into your night out in style. (Dec 2017)

You’ll probably skip the 12-course menu if you’re not famished, but a wagyu beef lover would well be tempted to give it a shot. There’s wagyu salad, a luxuriously prepared wagyu sukiyaki, and 3-kind wagyu sashimi moriawase where chef picks include wagyu wrapped around uni (sea urchin) and oyster topped with wagyu. The meat is Ozaki wagyu beef – a big deal since there’s only one farm in Japan that sells wagyu under this name – and finding a restaurant serving the same Ozaki beef is incredibly rare.If you’re looking for quality dishes that revolve around premium beef and done in Japanese style, book early for Ushidoki – especially since they claim to serve the whole cow in one course.

"Uya 四代目菊川 Japanese Unagi Restaurant","Uya 四代目菊川 may have opened its doors at Wheelock Place just recently, but it has served discerning diners for more than four generations back in Japan. What it does best is the exquisite, perfectly grilled traditional unagi and Uya 四代目菊川 aims to offer up its authentic rendition of the Japanese delicacy at affordable prices. The eels are carefully selected and this commitment to quality and freshness shows from the crispy, fluffy, and creamy unagi. In fact, the tare, or sauce, is made using Uya’s highly treasured secret recipe that has been passed down through the generations. The eel is delivered live from Japan and stored behind the kitchen before they are prepared and grilled daily.

The main star here’s definitely the Hitsumabushi served with condiments, broth, soup, and pickles. The best way to savour the different flavours is simply to divide the unagi rice into four portions and enjoy it with some condiments, with the dashi broth and condiments provided, on its own, or any way you like! Different flavours come through with every quarter, making for a delightful culinary experience that’s truly exciting. No part of the eel goes to waste, so don’t forget to try the Kimoyaki (grilled liver) and the Hone Senbei (Bone Crackers) - they taste as delicious as they sound intimidating. Don’t pass up on this gem even if you don’t enjoy unagi. Dishes such as the Rare Wagyu Rice Bowl, the Sashimi Moriawase, and Oyster Tempura will also give you plenty reason to return!

"Vatos Urban Tacos","Doling out zesty and delicious Korean-Mexican fusion fare isn’t an easy feat but the guys over at Vatos Urban Tacos make it seem effortless. With all three owners having roots in either California or Texas, and growing up on true-blue Mexican eats, it’s safe to say they know a thing or two about the flavour explosion the cuisine brings with it.

A quick glance at Vatos’ “Seoul-Mex” menu and you’ll know exactly what we mean. They dish out masterful fusion creations like the hefty Kimchi Galbi Grilled Cheese. Pieces of marinated Galbi short rib - bearing a moreish taste that comes from properly grilled meat - are sandwiched between slices of sourdough bread. Sounds simple? It's anything but. Each bite is a veritable bomb of umami, with Mexican cheese and savoury fried kimchi lending their own punchy kick.

The sandwich itself is pretty filling so if you prefer a slower pace, we recommend going for a range of their popular tacos. From Baja Fish to Chimichurri Chicken, these are the perfect portable snacks. Finally, no visit is complete without Kimchi Carnitas Fries plus a basket of Honey Tequila Chicken Wings to go with one of Vatos' signature margaritas, so be sure to order one (or two) of each before you head out!

The Walnut Crusted Bull Frog is another stellar option, highlighting frog legs from a Jurong farm paired perfectly with a teriyaki-sesame dressing.

Think audacious plates like the Carnivore Platter, a selection of prawn-paste chicken wings, five-spice roasted pork belly, and Teriyaki chicken, or innovative Mantou Sliders, with wobbly pork belly sandwiched not by brioche but fluffy fried mantou. Even the fries get a distinctive Asian makeover in the form of Seoul Jajang Bomb Fries topped with a spicy Korean minced-meat gravy and Nippon Seaweed Fries for a little umami hit with your calories.

Move over bubble teas; WAN is upping the bubble tea game with their popular Alcoholic Bubble Teas. The series feature nostalgic flavours with cheeky names such as LDR and The Singapore Fling - a sip of these concoctions will have you on cloud nine, for sure!

"Wan He Lou","We’re suckers for unexpected bursts of inspiration and Wan He Lou’s award-winning Lobster Porridge certainly qualifies. Catching a lobster during one of his typical leisurely diving trips off an isolated island, the lack of other ingredients forced Chef Lau Siaw Dee to throw together a quick meal using only rice, seawater, and the aforementioned crustacean. Surprise, surprise! The salty combination worked so well, it became an instant hit once Chef Lau brought it back home – after much refinement of course.
Today’s iteration is a Teochew-style porridge, whose loose grains float in a yellow broth that’s been richly flavoured with lobster roe, accompanied by a bevy of fresh lobsters sitting under a blanket of fresh spring onions. It’s both comforting and decadent without being too much on the palate. There’s also plenty more on the menu that can round out your meal, from seafood creations such as a Spicy Zesty Fried Red Snapper to poultry dishes like Seven Spice Pork Choplets and local staples like Braised Yee Fu Noodles and Sambal Fried Rice.
For mouth-watering Chinese food that’s packed with plenty of local flavour and an exceptional bowl of lobster porridge, only one place comes to mind. (May 2016)","Chinese, Seafood, Zi Char","Mon-Sun: 11am-2:30pm, 5-10:30pm","Casual Dining, Kid Friendly","65 Maude Road#01-01Singapore (208347)","$$"

With over 600 restaurants around the world, including four in Singapore, one wonders if anyone is still keeping track of the thank you tally, which must be in the trillions by now.

Birthed at a time of downturn in the Japanese economy, the Watami Group was conceived as a “casual restaurant”.

Indulge in sophisticated and distinctive cooking as you overlook a scenic view of the waterfront and immerse yourself in an outstanding dining experience.

One of Singapore’s most popular dishes, Chilli Crab, is a star item on the menu. Bite into firm, fragrant crab meat, and don’t forget to ration your mantou – the sauce is so fragrant and piquant that you’ll probably want to soak up every last drop! We also highly recommend the Grilled Sea Cucumber and Fish Maw with Scallion; apart from its anti-aging properties and its great nutritional value, the texture and complex flavours are sure to satisfy. The location of the restaurant might be a little out of the way for those who aren’t members of the marina club, but if you ask us whether it’s worth making the trip, our answer is a strong, unequivocal yes!

The hipster cafe trend has resulted in several must-have items on every self-respecting local cafe menu. A salted egg dish or two, a crab dish of some kind, truffle fries, craft beer. In this aspect, Workbench Bistro does not disappoint. It has not two, but four salted egg dishes on offer -- Salted Egg Chicken Pasta, Salted Egg Chicken Burger, Salted Egg Wings, and Salted Egg Wedges. The salted egg sauce is delightfully savory, and pairs well with the meats it comes with. There are two crab dishes, Crab Meat Linguine and Crab Cake Burger, that come chock full of fresh crab meat. If you come in a group, a must-order for sharing is the Signature Truffle Fries, which has that unmistakable aroma of truffle that is both appetizing and addictive.

XYT’s food, too, is loud, bold and in-your-face. Start your meal with the all-time classic, Braised Duck. At XYT, the meat of the duck is tender, yet provides enough of a bite to allow you to savour the juice of the sinews. To share, you will not regret ordering a Lu Rou Fan (braised meat on rice), which, at XYT, uses minced wagyu instead of the normal pork. The ubiquitous street food is thus upgraded to an almost unrecognisable form, but it is an evolution that we daresay is worth the calories. As the sun sets on Duxton Hill and lights from other eating establishments flicker on around you, sit back and reminisce about the days of old Duxton as you enjoy the retro charm with a cocktail or two from the XYT bar.

Nothing says special occasion quite like a Braised Whole Abalone in Superior Oyster Sauce, an entire lobe of the meaty treasure in an umami broth, paired with crunchy seasonal greens. A similar, less wallet-busting dish is the Braised Sea Supreme Cucumber with Corn Broth, a lovely blend of savoury and sweet flavours with the incomparable texture of high quality sea cucumber.

Cantonese cuisine is nothing without a soup centrepiece, and here there’s a stunning Double-boiled Sea Whelk Consommé with Garlic, served in a teapot for some extra theatre with the deep oceaney flavours. Meat dishes here come with a similarly high-end flourish. Think Pan-Fried Chicken with Morel in Superior Soy Sauce, a humble poultry dish given a dramatic gourmet kick with the addition of rare, earthy morels. Moving further along this French direction, two great cuisines meet in the form of a Pan-Seared A9 Wagyu Beef Fillet with Mushroom Sauce. If it’s dimsum and traditional Cantonese roasts you’re after, lunch and brunch on the weekends is the best time to hit up this joint, with its popular buffet options.

"Yellow Pot Restaurant and Bar","This chic Chinese restaurant in Six Senses Duxton hotel impresses with its sleek, black-and-gold modern design. The food here follows the clean eating philosophy adopted at Six Senses, which means you won’t find any additives or artificial flavourings in chef Sebastian Goh’s food.

A cold starter of organic vine-ripened tomatoes, for instance, are served with their skins thoughtfully removed as the red skins are believed to contain inflammatory properties. The tomatoes are then soaked in a house-made plum and herbal juice, rendering them sweet and refreshing.

Roast duck is a popular mainstay of Chinese restaurants, and the one at Yellow Pot is first marinated for two days in a fermented beancurd paste, then roasted over hickory wood so the meat is aromatic and tender with a glistening layer of crispy skin. Vegetables are not an afterthought here, too. Try the sweet and sour eggplant, where the aubergine is braised and coated with a delicious housemade sauce of hot bean paste, honey, vinegar, and Nanyang soya sauce brewed by a local company.

To pair with the food is a wide selection of teas, specially curated by Yixing Xuan Teahouse. You’ll be spoilt for choice with an extensive range that reflects the terroirs of China and Taiwan.

"Zaffron Kitchen (East Coast)","Taking orders and pleasing palates from an unusually hip, modern space in Katong, Zaffron Kitchen keeps more than its looks up-to-date with Indian flavours that encompass every dialect of the varied cuisine. From classic Hindustani tandoori to flaky Malay roti, Zaffron speaks the universal language of savoury Indian cuisine fluently.
A cool, younger cousin to the Westgate outlet, Zaffron Kitchen in Katong takes on the look preferred by many fresh-faced gastropubs and open dining concepts lately, but it's a novel makeunder for an Indian restaurant. A smattering of various seating arrangements from communal high tops to rustic wood bistro tables makes the space feel social. The dining area is grounded by floors made of modern concrete and vintage Perankan tiles, peppered with the common hue of deep saffron orange, and lit up by non-traditional fixtures. There's a children's area that encourages play, and the vibe in general is fluid and open.
The menu takes a similarly light and easygoing approach to Indian fare. A genre of cooking typically known for rich, hearty and spicy flavours, Indian cuisine is smartly organized into weekend only specialties of South Indian Dosai and Roti Prata, anytime snacks like crispy Bhel Puri and Samosa, and perennial North Indian classics of clay oven roasted Tandoori dishes and curries. The categories make the encyclopedic cuisine feel more accessible to those naan novices who are less familiar with Indian fare.
However those curry connoisseurs will be equally impressed with the complex, spot-on flavours of the offerings. The Fish Tikka here is especially scrumptious, made with salmon for a more unique texture that stands up to the marinade brilliantly. The Tandoori Malay Chicken Tikka, though it carries a similar name, has a distinctly different interplay between the medley of spices and the tender morsels of chicken. On the weekends, the Keema Dosai is a unique treat that must be tried. For the uninitiated, the familiar paper-thin, sourdough crepe is crisped fresh to order and filled with spiced minced ground meat. It's a killer, homestyle combination that you don't often see, which is a common theme at Zaffron Kitchen. Indian cuisine done so consistently well with modern approachability is certainly a rare sight - and taste - indeed.

For the uninitiated, the familiar paper-thin, sourdough crepe is crisped fresh to order and filled with spiced minced ground meat. It’s a killer, homestyle combinations that you don’t often see, which is a common theme at Zaffron Kitchen. Indian cuisine done so consistently well with modern approachability is certainly a rare sight- and taste- indeed.
